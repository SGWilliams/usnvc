This notebook provides some query patterns that are currently in pretty raw form to begin testing and refining toward what we want in the API.\n",

    "Currently, the very basic API is built as a Flask app running on a somewhat unstable virtual cloud machine via C9.io, so use at your own risk (to it not being available; but I'll try to kick the tires every once in a while :-). I have only exposed very basic, raw query and field filtering capability via \"q\" and \"fields\" parameters at this point (see examples below). We will refine this to limit how the system can be queried and make it simpler for non-expert users. That's the feedback I am looking for at this point - fields in the document structure to query, how to structure queries, etc.\n",

These same URLs can be executed in any browser or other code platform. The results are only available in the raw JSON document format coming back from the database at this point. We will use the API to drive a replacement for the web app at usnvc.org, but we should also examine whether or not the API itself needs to return any other format of the data."

       "   'Overview': {'Classification Comments': 'Plantations, ruderal, and native forest and woodland stands are typically placed in this class. Some plantation forests can be placed here rather than in <i>7. ~Agricultural & Developed Vegetation Cultural Class (CCL01)$$</i> despite having a canopy layer that may be very regular (spaced in planted rows), if the tree regeneration, shrub and ground layers develop spontaneously with irregular horizontal spacing, similar to native forests (i.e., regular human intervention does not occur for these layers). However, where plantations have highly regular horizontal structure, with regular human intervention in all layers (e.g., through cutting, spraying, ground-layer mowing), they may better be placed in <i>7. ~Agricultural & Developed Vegetation Cultural Class (CCL01)$$</i>.<br /><br />Similarly, tree-dominated vegetation that has a natural, irregular horizontal spacing in the tree layer, but highly regular shrub or herb layers because of human intervention, should be placed in <i>7. ~Agricultural & Developed Vegetation Cultural Class (CCL01)$$</i>. For example, shade coffee, cacao, and other woody agricultural crops grown under native (or exotic) tree species and in which all non-treed strata layers are subject to regular human intervention should be placed in that class.<br /><br />Included in this class are low-statured trees that overtop other growth forms. These include tree sapling and seedling stands with trees <2 m, where the tree growth form is at least 10% cover and overtops other growth forms. These include subarctic woodlands and coastal dwarf-tree woodlands that are <2 m but are single-stemmed with definite crowns. Conversely, treed bogs and fens, with low stunted trees and conical canopies, and otherwise sharing the moss and dwarf-shrub layers of open bogs and fens, are placed with those types. Where trees share the same strata as grasslands and shrublands (e.g., tallgrass brush prairie of 1-3 m, with trees <2 m), the vegetation is placed in the shrub- and herb-dominated classes.<br /><br />Tree cover ranges from 10-100%, and is inclusive of what are called forests, woodlands, and tree savannas, at least in the non-tropical regions. The class limit of 10% tree cover (for mesomorphic tree growth forms) follows that of FAO\\'s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2000 (FAO 2001). We exclude stands of trees planted primarily for agricultural production (such as fruit tree or forest plantations) and typically agroforestry, as well as those in developed lands, such as cities and roadsides (they are placed in Class 7, Formation 7.A.2). However, unlike FAO, we do not include what FAO calls \"temporarily unstocked areas\" (such as clearcuts, burnt areas) unless the tree growth form is actually present at 10% cover--even if in seedling or sapling form--and exceeds the height of other growth forms.<br /><br />Other classifications may limit forests and woodland to a narrower range of tree cover. For example, forests and woodlands are sometimes defined as 25-100% cover, and distinguished from tree savannas with 10-25% cover which are included under broadly defined grassland and shrubland classes (Driscoll et al. 1984, FGDC 1997, Grossman et al. 1998, Minnesota DNR 2005b). UNESCO (1973) required that tree savannas have a strong herbaceous layer (>50% graminoid cover). Still, a variety of definitions of tree savanna have been published, from the 10-25% cover noted above, to 10-30% cover in Nelson (2005), 10-40% in UNESCO (1973), and 10-50% cover in Curtis (1959). Blue oak, Engelmann oak, and other woodlands in California Mediterranean woodlands are typically between 10 and 60% cover, and California State ecologists place these in Forest & Woodland (Barbour et al. 2007). However, apart from tree savannas, there are many other forest and woodland types and regions where the degree of canopy closure plays less of a role in defining types, for example, forested swamps and bogs, longleaf pine woodlands (Peet 2006), eastern pine barrens, and subarctic woodlands.<br /><br />Thus, given the variety of situations, we have chosen a more inclusive definition of forest and woodland that encompasses most tree savanna concepts, and rely on lower levels of the hierarchy to make distinctions based on a combination of biogeography, ecology, and floristics. For example, in the context of the eastern Great Plains tallgrass prairie-forest border, it is common to recognize oak savannas, based on open tree cover levels (e.g., 5-30% tree cover in Nelson 2005), as separate from oak woodlands (30-80% cover) and oak forests (80-100% cover). Savannas may be distinguished from forests or woodlands, but these structural distinctions often correspond to lower-level units of the NVC hierarchy (e.g., group, alliance, and association). Still, Dixon et al. (2014) and others suggest that there may be good ecological reasons to treat upland tropical tree savannas, with 10-40% tree cover, trees <8 m tall, and a substantial graminoid layer as part of <i>2. ~Shrub & Herb Vegetation Class (C02)$$</i>, and we allow for that option here.',\n",

       "   'Overview': {'Classification Comments': 'This class includes both non-treed grasslands and shrublands, and open tree savannas, where tree canopy cover is typically <10%. Non-tropical tree savannas, defined by a strong graminoid layer (>50% in UNESCO 1973) and some level of open tree cover (10-25% cover in UNESCO (1973), 10-30% cover in Nelson (2005), 10-50% cover in Curtis (1959)), often closely resemble open upland grasslands and shrublands, especially in grassland regions. Thus, in this particular realm of vegetation, the open tree canopy, in combination with the ground layer, helps define savanna vegetation, distinct from forests or woodlands (e.g., Nelson 2005). But in many other regions and vegetation types (e.g., forested swamps and bogs, longleaf pine woodlands (Peet 2006), California oak woodlands (Barbour et al. 2007), subarctic woodlands), the role of canopy closure varies. Thus, in non-tropical regions, we generally place tree savannas, where trees >5 m have >10% cover, with woodland and forest. However, as Dixon et al. (2014) and others suggest, there may be good ecological reasons to treat upland tropical tree savannas, with up to 40% tree cover, trees <8 m tall, and a substantial graminoid layer, as part of <i>2. ~Shrub & Herb Vegetation Class (C02)$$</i>, and we allow for that option here.<br /><br />Croplands with a spontaneous ground layer of \"weeds,\" where the annual rotation of crops prevents a persistent ground layer of herbs, are treated in <i>7. ~Agricultural & Developed Vegetation Cultural Class (CCL01)$$</i>. If agricultural practices are abandoned, these sites may succeed to more persistent \"ruderal\" grasslands and shrublands (and forests) and would be placed in this class.<br /><br />Where grasses and shrubs overtop low trees (\"brush prairie\"), the stands are placed here in Shrub & Herb Vegetation. These situations may often occur in grassland or cool semi-desert regions (e.g., North American Great Plains or Great Basin). Also challenging are some scrub trees, such as juniper (<i>Juniperus</i> spp.) or mesquite (<i>Prosopis</i> spp.), which can form shrub-like stands, and are typically <5 m tall at maturity in parts of their range. Where forms are not easily defined, woody plants equal to or >5 m at maturity are considered trees (FGDC 2008). In the United States, there are shrubby junipers (<i>Juniperus communis, Juniperus pinchotii</i>) that should be treated as shrubs. But pygmy conifers can potentially make 5 m and are treated as trees (<i>Pinus edulis, Juniperus scopulorum, Juniperus monosperma, Juniperus occidentalis, Juniperus osteosperma</i>).<br /><br />There is a group of ephemerals that are generally mesomorphic, which can, under optimal rainfall conditions, grow on sand, including desert sands and pavement. They are adapted to deserts through their seed characteristics. Typically they do not occupy extensive deep shifting sands, only margins of sandsheets and more stable sands. They rely on seedbanks that may persist for decades in the sand and germinate under optimal winter or summer episodes of heavy rains. These are treated here as part of the mesomorphic shrub and herb class. Examples of psammophytic species include some sand verbenas (<i>Abronia</i> spp.) and several Asteraceae (e.g., <i>Dicoria canescens, Palafoxia</i> spp., etc.).',\n",

Review is needed on the placement of páramo and puna in South America. Currently only super-páramo and higher elevation puna are placed here, as this class is restricted to the more strongly cryomorphic high montane forms of puna and páramos (e.g., in Venezuela there are stands dominated by cryomorphic growth forms but lack the typical grass cover). This is because lower elevation páramo and moist puna have mesomorphic grasses covering the ground (often exceeding 80% cover), whereas cryomorphic shrubs and herbs, although present and conspicuous, may be <20% cover. These lower elevation stands also lack any cryoturbation. Using these criteria, we would place these lower elevation stands in the mesomorphic \"Tropical Montane Grassland & Shrubland\" formation. On the other hand, we don\\'t yet have a working set of \"cryomorphic herbs\" versus \"mesomorphic herb\" growth forms so it is hard to know how to weigh the presence of these mesomorphic herbs against the cryomorphic shrubs.

       "   'Overview': {'Classification Comments': 'This class is defined by primarily nonvascular, often crustose lichen, ferns or very sparse other vascular vegetation that is controlled by the rocky substrate. The substrate can be classed as either stable (large boulders, outcrops, monoliths, etc.) or unstable (colluvium such as scree, talus or dense, alluvial cobble). Stable substrates prevent vascular plant roots from penetrating. Species adapted to such substrates have no roots and occupy the surface of the substrates, such as nonvasculars (lichens, mosses, liverworts), or are largely prevented from growing on the substrate, except in localized fissures or cracks. Whenever the vegetation is able to establish sufficient cover on the rocky surface (typically >10% cover), the growth forms of the vegetation determine the class. Vascular spore-bearing plants (ferns and others) are included in this class. Spikemoss (<i>Selaginella</i>) regularly adheres to cliff and outcrops, as do many species of ferns such as <i>Polypodium, Cheilanthes, Pellaea</i>, etc.<br /><br />Lithology may be consolidated or unconsolidated, but the conditions of the substrate preclude development of soil and either strongly impede the penetration of roots or require specialized adaptations of roots to support the plant species. Lithomorphic Vegetation may be similar to desert or polar types where climate <i>per se</i> limits the overall plant growth, and substrate limitations are secondary.<br /><br />Open sand dunes are excluded from this class in general as open sand dunes are an extreme condition of other classes (i.e., mesomorphic, xeromorphic), where the constant movement of sand (ablation, deposition, etc.) is at too extreme a pace for even the typical adaptations of psammophytic plants, such as creeping stolons, rhizomes, etc., to keep up.<br /><br />Larson et al. (2000b) characterize cliffs as having a \"high, steep, or overhanging face of rock,\" whereas rock outcrop is a \"portion of bedrock protruding through the soil.\" Lava flows and colluvial deposits would lay over the soil. They include both consolidated and unconsolidated cliffs in their definition, including sand, gravel or loess, as well as rock cliffs. Here we restrict it to rock (or at least very rocklike) materials. Apart from stating that a cliff need only be \"high enough that falling off will kill you,\" they suggest that even 3 m of height is sufficient to create suitable cliff habitat.<br /><br />Defining this class to include sparse vascular vegetation stands that are limited in their cover because of substrate is an issue. For example, scree vegetation could be considered very similar to psammophytic (dune and other sandy) vegetation and be treated as an extreme form of mesomorphic vegetation [mostly or all in <i>2. ~Shrub & Herb Vegetation Class (C02)$$</i>]. Scree is usually dominated by sparse vascular plants, has considerable soil development for vascular plant establishment, but has unstable substrate on which nonvascular vegetation cannot become well-established (C. Lea pers. comm. 2012). However, whereas dunes can have vegetation that greatly exceeds 10% cover, this is less common on scree; by-and-large, the vascular vegetation remains sparse, and nonvascular vegetation is typical. Talus is generally stable enough that it has significant nonvascular vegetation, whereas scree may be unstable and less commonly contains a strong nonvascular component; further review of this distinction is needed. Thus talus fits in this Open Rock Vegetation Class based on the nonvascular vegetation criteria, and scree fits in this class because of the sparse vascular vegetation, perhaps in combination with nonvascular vegetation.<br /><br />Further review may suggest that this class can be improved by distinguishing (probably at the subclass level), the less \"rocklike\" vegetation (including vegetation on scree, badlands, pavement) from the true solid rock vegetation (C. Lea pers. comm. 2012). Scree and other loose rocky substrates (volcanic cinders) typically have enough soil development to support a dominant layer of disturbance-adapted, facultative mesomorphic shrubs and/or herbs (e.g., in the United States, <i>Ribes</i> spp., <i>Prunus virginiana</i>, and other forest, woodland, or shrubland shrubs in the central Rockies), and true lithomorphs (saxicolous lichens) are quite sparse, if present at all. Although the surface may be \"rocky,\" the driving ecological factor is the availability of soil in quantity under the relatively shallow rock armoring and the absence of large, stable substrates for true lithomorphs (saxicolous lichens) to establish. Cobbles along rivers and streams may also not typically support lithomorphic growth forms, and may best be treated as sometimes sparse flooded types within mesomorphic formations. Badlands (hard clays) and desert pavements also tend to support facultative vascular species, as opposed to lithomorphs or lithophiles, and could be considered for the xeromorphic class. Given this narrower definition of open rock vegetation, a requirement for <10% vascular cover and nonvascular cover greater than vascular cover may be more appropriate, to separate them from sparse or occasionally sparse types (scree, volcanic cinders) in which vascular layers are clearly dominant and lithomorphic nonvascular is insignificant (C. Lea pers. comm. 2012).',\n",

The substrates are mostly fine- to medium-textured, stony on the surface (loose stony pavement), with a muddy matrix that is saturated with meltwater and freezes daily. In tropical mountains, surface layers that freeze may overlie unfrozen subsurface layers. An important effect of frost-heaving is the upward movement of stones in soils and unconsolidated deposits that is more rapid and pervasive in wetter soils with a sparse vegetation cover. The process associated with frost can also cause upward or downward displacement of soil material in mass that can result in slope cryoplanation terraces at several scales.

       "   'Overview': {'Classification Comments': 'The páramo and the dry and moist puna are not included in this subclass, because they have primarily mesomorphic adaptations, and because the soils are not subject to cryogenic processes. These vegetation types are treated with <i>2.A.2 ~Tropical Montane Grassland & Shrubland Formation (F017)$$</i>. Nonetheless, although the páramo and the dry and moist puna are not subject to cryogenic soil processes, they are subject to varying levels of freezing. Perhaps the term \"cryomorphic\" places too great a restriction on the concept of \"tropical alpine\" vegetation.<br /><br />Also challenging to place consistently in this class is the South American xerophytic vegetation of the Altiplano region of central and southern Bolivia, northern Argentina, and Chile, because the cryomorphic definition is very similar to xeromorphic; that is to say, they share ecological processes and have similar structures (growth forms) to each other. The vegetation is not Cool Semi-Desert, but is a hot/cold semi-desert, while at the same time is hardly affected by edaphic processes of cryoturbation and geliturbation expected of the cryomorphic class. We find again the diurnal rhythm of ice/thaw of the tropical mountains, but it is marked in these high dry southern areas with very high daily solar temperatures and very low nocturnal temperatures. For example, in the Great Salt Flats of Uyuni (Salar de Uyuni) to 3800 m of altitude, during the day temperatures can rise to 20°C and at night to -20°C. This is an extreme case related to the immense salt flats, but the lands that surround them repeat almost the same features listed above, although with smaller thermal amplitudes (C. Josse pers. comm. 2011). So high-elevation semi-deserts share some characteristics with the tropical high montane vegetation.',\n",

Ionic composition of waters varies widely. The upper limits of salinity for Freshwater Aquatic Vegetation are set at 0.5 ppt, above which the vegetation is considered <i>5.A ~Saltwater Aquatic Vegetation Subclass (S09)$$</i>. Dissolved minerals, acid-base balances, and nutrient levels are influenced by the hydrology, underlying geological materials, nutrient fluxes, and plant communities. Freshwater Aquatic Vegetation is usually situated on substrates of limnic peat, mixed limnic organic-mineral material, and marl in stable-water regimes. Little sediment accumulation occurs in high-energy shallow waters such as tidal regimes, rivers or large lakes. In semi-arid regions, shallow waters dry up intermittently, often leaving evaporite alkaline salt deposits. Except in highly saline or acidic waters, these deposits provide a substrate for rooted submerged and floating macrophytes, algae and aquatic mosses (National Wetlands Working Group 1997).<br /><br />Freshwater Aquatic Vegetation is found in shallow water that usually has standing or flowing water <2 m deep in mid-summer. Water levels are seasonally stable, permanently flooded, or intermittently exposed during droughts or low flows. Shallow-water vegetation may also occupy bays and margins of profundal zones of lakes (National Wetlands Working Group 1997).<br /><br />Freshwater Aquatic Vegetation occurs in ponds, pools, shallow lakes, oxbows, sloughs, natural and artificial impoundments, or channels. Boundaries are determined by water-eroded shorelines, beaches or landward margins of mudflats, recent limnic deposits, floating mats, emergents or hydrophytic trees or shrubs. Bordering mats of rooted emergent vegetation, including inundated trees, may occupy up to 10% of the shallow-water area. Shallow waters are found in all hydrogeomorphic settings, but are usually associated with lacustrine, fluvial, stream, river, and permafrost systems (National Wetlands Working Group 1997).'},\n",

That is, it may be desirable to first assign a lake or river type to the aquatic system, and secondarily note the NVC vegetation type present. Vegetation found in many urban and agricultural ponds may be very similar to natural freshwater aquatic vegetation, because agricultural and urban ponds typically manipulate the physical setting, not the vegetation itself. There are distinct cultural aquatic vegetation types, but these should be limited to situations in which the vegetation itself is manipulated for horticultural (e.g., aquatic gardens) or agricultural (e.g., water chestnuts grown in impoundments, rice paddies) that are parallel with terrestrial cultural vegetation. However, many agricultural ponds may actively prevent vegetation from forming. For practical applications of classification and mapping of freshwater aquatic vegetation, the agricultural and urban ponds may be initially placed within the <i>7. ~Agricultural & Developed Vegetation Cultural Class (CCL01)$$</i>, and, where evidence is gathered to show they have a natural composition, they may be reclassified.',\n",

       "  'Overview': {'Classification Comments': 'This class includes both non-treed grasslands and shrublands, and open tree savannas, where tree canopy cover is typically <10%. Non-tropical tree savannas, defined by a strong graminoid layer (>50% in UNESCO 1973) and some level of open tree cover (10-25% cover in UNESCO (1973), 10-30% cover in Nelson (2005), 10-50% cover in Curtis (1959)), often closely resemble open upland grasslands and shrublands, especially in grassland regions. Thus, in this particular realm of vegetation, the open tree canopy, in combination with the ground layer, helps define savanna vegetation, distinct from forests or woodlands (e.g., Nelson 2005). But in many other regions and vegetation types (e.g., forested swamps and bogs, longleaf pine woodlands (Peet 2006), California oak woodlands (Barbour et al. 2007), subarctic woodlands), the role of canopy closure varies. Thus, in non-tropical regions, we generally place tree savannas, where trees >5 m have >10% cover, with woodland and forest. However, as Dixon et al. (2014) and others suggest, there may be good ecological reasons to treat upland tropical tree savannas, with up to 40% tree cover, trees <8 m tall, and a substantial graminoid layer, as part of <i>2. ~Shrub & Herb Vegetation Class (C02)$$</i>, and we allow for that option here.<br /><br />Croplands with a spontaneous ground layer of \"weeds,\" where the annual rotation of crops prevents a persistent ground layer of herbs, are treated in <i>7. ~Agricultural & Developed Vegetation Cultural Class (CCL01)$$</i>. If agricultural practices are abandoned, these sites may succeed to more persistent \"ruderal\" grasslands and shrublands (and forests) and would be placed in this class.<br /><br />Where grasses and shrubs overtop low trees (\"brush prairie\"), the stands are placed here in Shrub & Herb Vegetation. These situations may often occur in grassland or cool semi-desert regions (e.g., North American Great Plains or Great Basin). Also challenging are some scrub trees, such as juniper (<i>Juniperus</i> spp.) or mesquite (<i>Prosopis</i> spp.), which can form shrub-like stands, and are typically <5 m tall at maturity in parts of their range. Where forms are not easily defined, woody plants equal to or >5 m at maturity are considered trees (FGDC 2008). In the United States, there are shrubby junipers (<i>Juniperus communis, Juniperus pinchotii</i>) that should be treated as shrubs. But pygmy conifers can potentially make 5 m and are treated as trees (<i>Pinus edulis, Juniperus scopulorum, Juniperus monosperma, Juniperus occidentalis, Juniperus osteosperma</i>).<br /><br />There is a group of ephemerals that are generally mesomorphic, which can, under optimal rainfall conditions, grow on sand, including desert sands and pavement. They are adapted to deserts through their seed characteristics. Typically they do not occupy extensive deep shifting sands, only margins of sandsheets and more stable sands. They rely on seedbanks that may persist for decades in the sand and germinate under optimal winter or summer episodes of heavy rains. These are treated here as part of the mesomorphic shrub and herb class. Examples of psammophytic species include some sand verbenas (<i>Abronia</i> spp.) and several Asteraceae (e.g., <i>Dicoria canescens, Palafoxia</i> spp., etc.).',\n",

Cool-temperate and warm-temperate forests may be difficult to distinguish, but cool-temperate forests are more strongly dominated by broad-leaved deciduous trees, and broad-leaved evergreen trees are essentially absent. Braun (1950) includes at least parts of these warm-temperate forests in her \"Deciduous Forest Formation\" (the \"Southeastern Evergreen Forest Region\"), but briefly notes a \"Subtropical Broad-leaved Evergreen Forest\" that includes central Florida southward.<br /><br />Various ecoregional treatments recognize the distinct vegetation and climate of the warm-temperate region, e.g., Brown et al. (1998) separates cool-temperate from warm-temperate vegetation. Walter (1985) recognizes two warm-temperate biomes, the \"Zonobiome of the Winter-Rain Region with an Arid-Humid Climate and Sclerophyllic Woodlands\" (Zone IV) and the \"Zonobiome of the Warm-Temperate Humid Climate\" (Zone V), distinct from the cool-temperate biome \"Zonobiome of the Temperate-Nemoral Climate\" (Zone VI) and the boreal biome \"Zonobiome of the Cold-Temperate Boreal Climate\" (Zone VIII). Similarly, Schultz (1995) recognizes the two warm-temperate regions, which he refers to as: \"Mediterranean-Type subtropics\" (with world distribution shown in his Figure 129) and \"Humid subtropics\" (with world distribution shown in his Figure 171). We prefer the term warm-temperate to subtropics. Schultz states that \"apart from the driest sites and those with lowest nutrient contents, all the regions of the Mediterranean-Type subtropics were originally covered by forests of mostly evergreen sclerophyllous species of trees\" and in the European Mediterranean region, these were mostly evergreen oak, such as <i>Quercus ilex</i>. Today, many of these regions are more typically dominated by sclerophyllous shrub formations, as described in 2.B.1 ~Mediterranean Scrub & Grassland Formation (F038)$$.',\n",

Cool-temperate forests may occur as minor components of southern and montane New Zealand and in Australia, especially Tasmania. Cool-temperate forests also occur in Chile.<br /><br />Inclusion of western North American conifer forests and woodlands in this temperate formation (rather a broadly defined boreal and temperate conifer forest) follows that of Brandt (2009). However, some authors expand the boreal formation to include the subalpine or high montane forests within the temperate zone (e.g., Whittaker (1975) - the \"subarctic-subalpine needle-leaved forests\"; Brown et al. (1998) - Boreal and Subalpine Forest &amp; Woodland). Within North America, this creates challenges for placement of <i>Picea rubens</i> (red spruce) forests in the northern temperate region, which are partly subalpine or high montane, but are most common at lower elevations. We follow a more floristic, biogeographic and ecological approach in treating the subalpine forests with their lower elevation counterparts at the formation level. But we recognize that high montane and subalpine forests are also similar to boreal forests in regard to some aspects of climate, species diversity patterns, and floristic similarity (at least at the genus level). Warm-temperate and cool-temperate forest &amp; woodland formations are very similar, but differences are driven by increasing presence of broad-leaved evergreen trees and shrubs, and evergreen herb layer that corresponds with broad climatic patterns. Overlap with boreal forests in the western montane region also presents conceptual challenges.',\n",

       "   'Overview': {'Classification Comments': 'This formation includes a range of conifer and broad-leaved hardwood growth forms. The formation is sometimes restricted to \"temperate broadleaf forest regions,\" but even there, pure conifer stands can occur, e.g., in temperate eastern North America, there are pure conifer stands of <i>Tsuga canadensis</i> and <i>Pinus strobus</i>. Inclusion of western North American conifer forests in this cool-temperate formation rather than the Boreal Forest & Woodland follows that of Brandt (2009) and others. Warm-temperate and cool-temperate forest and woodland formations are very similar, but differences are driven by broad climatic patterns. Overlap with boreal forests in the western montane region also presents conceptual challenges.<br /><br />Various ecoregional treatments recognize the distinct vegetation and climate of the cool-temperate region, e.g., Brown et al. (1998) separate cool-temperate from warm-temperate vegetation. Walter (1985) recognizes the cool-temperate biome \"Zonobiome of the Temperate-Nemoral Climate\" (Zone VI) distinct from two warm-temperate biomes, the \"Zonobiome of the Winter-Rain Region with an Arid-Humid Climate and Sclerophyllic Woodlands\" (Zone IV) and the \"Zonobiome of the Warm-Temperate Humid Climate\" (Zone V), and from the boreal biome \"Zonobiome of the Cold-temperate Boreal Climate\" (Zone VIII).<br /><br />Our approach treats the subalpine forests of the Rocky Mountain region as part of <i>1.B.2 ~Cool Temperate Forest & Woodland Formation (F008)$$</i>, rather than as part of <i>1.B.4 ~Boreal Forest & Woodland Formation (F001)$$</i>, such as done by Whittaker (1975) and Brown et al. (1998). Our decision is in line with a more biogeographic approach for divisions, and corresponds to that of Rivas-Martinez et al. (1999b), but is debatable from a structural and climatic perspective. As Chris Lea (pers. comm. 2012) notes, one could retain lowland and lower montane western coniferous forests in Cool Temperate, but move high montane and subalpine to the Boreal formation, to which they also have strong floristic and environmental similarities (this would require a name change of the latter to something like \"Boreal & High Montane\" or \"Boreal & Subalpine\" formation). This would have minimal impact on lower level units, requiring only a transfer of two current western North America groups (G020 and G025) to F001, under a new (western North American) division of F001 and eastern North America group G024 (requires a new macrogroup and division, but the description of these would be identical with the existing group description). The only major new description for Forests and Woodlands would be a new division description for \"Western North America High Montane & Subalpine Forest,\" within formation F001. These forests, fairly simply, contain quaking aspen and lodgepole pine on up through the Engelmann spruce-fir types. In the Sierra Nevada, Ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, \"mixed conifers\" (white fir, etc.) represent the upper limits of <i>1.B.3 ~Temperate Flooded & Swamp Forest Formation (F026)$$</i>. The Shrubland & Grassland class needs no formation-level adjustments, but some lower level adjustments might be needed for consistency. We will continue to review this issue as we compare our work with that of Eurasian treatments of boreal and cool-temperate (nemoral) forests.',\n",

       "    'Type Concept': 'Cool Temperate Forest & Woodland includes temperate deciduous forest and woodland, temperate needle-leaved forest and woodland, and temperate rainforest. These forests are dominated by broad-leaved or needle-leaved tree growth forms. Rainforest trees may attain great heights; trees easily exceed 50 m, but these forests more typically range from 10 to 30 m in height. They are found in oceanic temperate to cool-temperate continental climates, with summer rainfall and cold winters (during which the broad-leaved trees lose their leaves), extending to treeline, where they resemble boreal forests.<br /><br />The formation is most prominent in the Northern Hemisphere, where it occurs in four major, formation expressions in (1) western and central Europe, (2) eastern Asia, including Korea and Japan, (3) eastern North America, and (4) western North America. It occurs as small formation expressions in the Southern Hemisphere, including southern South America (Chile and Argentina), southern Australia, and New Zealand. This formation is associated with cooler continental and oceanic temperate climates (Koeppen Dca, Dcb, and Do, and in Europe, Cfb). There is an approximately 6-month growing season. The 50 to 150 cm (20-60 inches) of precipitation is distributed evenly throughout the year. The non-growing season is due to temperature-induced drought during the cold winters.<br /><br />Forest structure is usually complex in moist climates and habitats, commonly consisting of five strata: (1) a tree stratum, 15-35 m (60-100 feet) tall, dominated by broad-leaved deciduous and/or needle-leaved evergreen species, often with a substratum of small trees (5-15 m tall); (2) a small-tree and tall-sapling layer (between 2-5 m); (3) a short-shrub layer (<2 m); (4) an herb layer of perennial forbs, including an ecological group with species that bloom primarily in early spring (in deciduous broadleaf-dominated examples); and (5) a ground layer of lichens, clubmosses, and true mosses. Lichens and mosses also grow on the trunks of trees. In dry and fire-dependent climates and regions, the structure may be simple, with a tree layer (>10%) and a strong grassy or shrubby ground layer.

In dry and fire-dependent climates and regions, the structure may be simple, with a tree layer (>10%) and a strong grassy or shrubby ground layer. In western North America, structure is more variable, reflecting the range of ecological sites, from high mountains and valleys, to coastal rainforests with a variety of mesoclimates. Structural variability ranges from short-statured conifers, with a sparse understory and heavy duff layer, to the tallest and largest trees in the world in moist to wet climates, with shrub, herb and moss growth forms prominent (Whittaker 1975).<br /><br />Many of the genera, previously part of an Arcto-Tertiary Geoflora, are common to all three of the disjunct Northern Hemisphere broadleaf expressions of this biome.

Different species of these genera occur on each continent. In the Southern Hemisphere different sets of genera and species are found. Western North America contains a much reduced set of hardwood genera and expanded conifer diversity (<i>Abies, Picea, Pinus, Pseudotsuga, Thuja, Tsuga</i>). Transitions to the boreal forests are also apparent.<br /><br />The temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere differ from their northern counterparts. Distinctions between warm-temperate and cool-temperate are much contracted (e.g., in parts of the evergreen southern beech <i>Nothofagus</i> forests in South America, Australia and New Zealand).'},\n",

Below are some of the relevant comments. In addition, this description certainly needs review and additions for interior British Columbia or southern Alberta characteristics.<br /><br />How to treat <i>Pinus flexilis</i> in the Rocky Mountains is still somewhat uncertain. For now, there are three groups which have limber pine as a component. The limber pine group included in this macrogroup is composed predominantly of limber pine or juniper that is elevationally below the zone of continuous lower montane forests found in the main Rocky Mountain cordillera. The associations placed in this group are restricted to foothill settings on rock outcrops, or to escarpments in the Great Plains, and in Montana, these are limestone outcrops (L. Vance pers. comm. 2014). Associations extending from the foothill zone into the subalpine, such as ~<i>Pinus flexilis / Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i> Woodland (CEGL000802)$$, are included in ~Rocky Mountain Subalpine-Montane Limber Pine - Bristlecone Pine Woodland Group (G221)$$. Additionally, there are <i>Juniperus osteosperma</i>-dominated stands included in this group from the Pryor, Big Horn, and Laramie mountain ranges because these stands are significantly disjunct from the main distribution of <i>Juniperus osteosperma</i> in the Colorado Plateau and Great Basin regions and have floristic similarities to the Great Plains.<br /><br />Forests and woodlands of mixed <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> and <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> in this macrogroup need some review of concepts in relation to other groups and macrogroups, including ~Central Rocky Mountain Mesic Grand Fir - Douglas-fir Forest Group (G211)$$ (in ~Central Rocky Mountain Mesic Lower Montane Forest Macrogroup (M500)$$) and ~East Cascades Mesic Grand Fir - Douglas-fir Forest Group (G212)$$ (placed in ~Vancouverian Lowland & Montane Forest Macrogroup (M024)$$). In PNV (PAGs) concept, this is mostly <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>, moist <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> series, dry <i>Abies grandis</i>, or warm, dry <i>Abies lasiocarpa</i> series in the Canadian Rockies, northern Middle Rockies, eastern Cascades and Okanagan ecoregions. Everett et al. (2000) indicate that in the eastern Cascades of Washington, this group forms fire polygons due to abrupt north and south topography with presettlement fire-return intervals of 11-12 years typically covering less than 810 ha. Currently, fires have 40- to 45-year return intervals with thousands of hectares in size. ~East Cascades Mesic Grand Fir - Douglas-fir Forest Group (G212)$$ has a North Pacific floristic composition and is mostly found in the East Cascades ecoregion, peripheral in Okanagan ecoregion, and West Cascades. For now, this macrogroup does not include any <i>Abies grandis</i>-named associations. It may be that some of the drier end of <i>Abies grandis</i> forests should be included in this macrogroup, as they may well be mixed with <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> or <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>.<br /><br />Forests and woodlands of the middle Rocky Mountains dominated by <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>, which are included in this macrogroup, need to be clarified as to placement; they are related to groups currently in other macrogroups; e.g. ~Central Rocky Mountain Mesic Grand Fir - Douglas-fir Forest Group (G211)$$ in ~Central Rocky Mountain Mesic Lower Montane Forest Macrogroup (M500)$$, and ~East Cascades Mesic Grand Fir - Douglas-fir Forest Group (G212)$$ in ~Vancouverian Lowland & Montane Forest Macrogroup (M024)$$. Also, its transition in the south to ~Southern Rocky Mountain White Fir - Douglas-fir Dry Forest Group (G226)$$ in ~Southern Rocky Mountain Lower Montane Forest Macrogroup (M022)$$ needs to be clarified. Certainly this macrogroup is outside the range of distribution of either <i>Picea pungens</i> or <i>Abies concolor</i>, which are major components of the southern Rocky Mountain forest macrogroup. It also does not overlap with major interior Pacific Northwest forest types which are affiliated with a more maritime climate regime, where trees such as <i>Tsuga heterophylla, Thuja plicata, Larix occidentalis, Abies grandis</i>, or <i>Pinus monticola</i> occur. The floristic \"transition\" from middle to southern Rocky Mountains is not yet clear. Woodlands dominated by <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> found in breaks along rivers and on escarpments in central and eastern Montana and Wyoming are included in this macrogroup.<br /><br />Regarding <i>Pinus ponderosa</i>, this macrogroup includes the northern race of Interior Ponderosa Pine old-growth (USFS Region 6, USFS Region 1). The FEIS site describes different varieties of <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> and associated species. This macrogroup of the Central Rockies is primarily <i>Pinus ponderosa var. ponderosa</i> (Habeck 1992). Johansen and Latta (2003) have mapped the distribution of two varieties (<i>Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum</i> and <i>Pinus ponderosa var. ponderosa</i>) using mitochondrial DNA. They hybridize along the Continental Divide in Montana backing up the FEIS information. ~Southern Rocky Mountain Lower Montane Forest Macrogroup (M022)$$ includes forests and woodlands where <i>Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum, Pinus ponderosa var. brachyptera</i>, and <i>Pinus arizonica var. arizonica</i> are the predominant ponderosa varieties. The transition between these two macrogroups (M501 and M022) is now defined to occur in the montane zones of the Bighorns (USFS section M331B) and Laramie Range (USFS section M331I) and to the east and south of these mountains. The southern Rocky Mountain macrogroup (M022) will also occur in other isolated mountain ranges of central Wyoming, but not in eastern Wyoming. It does not occur farther north than Wyoming; all western Montana ponderosa pine woodlands are placed into this macrogroup (M501). Ponderosa pine woodlands and \"steppes\" in eastern Wyoming, eastern and central Montana, including the Missouri River Breaks, are also included in this macrogroup, and are predominantly <i>Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum</i>. Ponderosa pine woodlands found in the Great Plains do show some floristic similarities to these found within the forested mountains of the Southern Rockies, but typically have herbaceous floristics related to the Great Plains \"mixedgrass.\" The southern extent of the ponderosa pine woodlands included in this macrogroup is hard to determine, but farther south in Colorado, there is more <i>Juniperus, Pinus edulis</i>, and <i>Quercus gambelii</i>. Stands of ponderosa pine at Black Mesa in western Oklahoma and in southeastern Colorado are currently included with the southern Rocky Mountain ponderosa pine woodlands in M022. South of the Modoc Plateau in California, <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> forests and woodlands are included in ~Southern Vancouverian Montane-Foothill Forest Macrogroup (M023)$$.',\n",

This is a very wide-ranging macrogroup; it has common substrate and soil characteristics across its range, but from west to east shifts from a climate regime moderately influenced by maritime air masses, to one that is entirely continental. Generally these communities occur in lower montane to foothill settings, or on rock outcrops in the mixedgrass region of the Great Plains. Occurrences are found on all slopes and aspects; however, moderately steep to very steep slopes or ridgetops and plateaus are most common. Substrates tend to be composed of limestone, sandstone, dolomite, granite, colluvium, unweathered lava flows, pumice, cinders, or eolian sands. In most cases soil features include good aeration and drainage, coarse textures, circumneutral to slightly acidic pH, an abundance of mineral material, and periods of drought during the growing season.<br /><br />Most of the communities in this macrogroup are fire-dependent types. Presettlement fire regimes may have been characterized by frequent, low-intensity surface fires that maintained relatively open stands of a mix of fire-resistant species. <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> forests were probably subject to a moderate-severity fire regime in presettlement times, with fire-return intervals of 30-100 years. Many of the important tree species in these forests and woodlands are fire-adapted (<i>Populus tremuloides, Pinus ponderosa, Pinus contorta</i>), and fire-induced reproduction of <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> can result in its continued codominance in <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> forests. A subset of the macrogroup includes woodlands and scrub patches that are edaphically controlled rather than fire-dependent. In the limber pine - juniper woodlands, fire is infrequent and spotty because the rocky substrates prevent development of a continuous vegetation canopy needed to spread fire. In other locations, where ponderosa pine is the predominant tree, periodic drought or areas of sand dunes, scablands, and pumice limit tree establishment. This climate-edaphic interaction results in widely scattered trees over \"shrub-steppe\" of sagebrush, bitterbrush, or sparsely distributed grasses. Tree growth is likely episodic, with regeneration episodes in years with available moisture. The expansion of <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> woodlands from the Black Hills montane zone into the central Great Plains may be due to fire suppression.',\n",

This climate-edaphic interaction results in widely scattered trees over \"shrub-steppe\" of sagebrush, bitterbrush, or sparsely distributed grasses. Tree growth is likely episodic, with regeneration episodes in years with available moisture. Tree density is limited in some areas by available growing space due to rocky conditions of the site. Hence the tree canopy in these locations will never reach woodland density or close due to the interaction of climate and edaphic factors, even in the absence of fire. They burn occasionally, but the vegetation is sparse enough that fires are typically not carried through the stand. Fire frequency is speculated to be 30-50 years. Some stands also occur on areas of sand dunes, scablands, and pumice where the edaphic conditions limit tree abundance.<br /><br /><i>Pinus ponderosa</i> is a drought-resistant, shade-intolerant conifer which usually occurs at lower treeline in the major ranges of the western United States. Historically, surface fires and drought were influential in maintaining open-canopy conditions in these woodlands. With settlement and subsequent fire suppression, occurrences have become denser. Presently, some occurrences contain understories of more shade-tolerant species, such as <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> and/or <i>Abies</i> spp., as well as younger cohorts of <i>Pinus ponderosa</i>. These altered structures have affected fuel loads and fire regimes. Presettlement fire regimes were primarily frequent (5- to 15-year return intervals), low-intensity surface fires triggered by lightning strikes or deliberately set by Native Americans. With fire suppression and increased fuel loads, fire regimes are now less frequent and often become intense crown fires, which can kill mature <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> (Reid et al. 1999). Establishment is erratic and believed to be linked to periods of adequate soil moisture and good seed crops as well as fire frequencies, which allow seedlings to reach sapling size. Longer fire-return intervals have resulted in many occurrences having dense subcanopies of overstocked and unhealthy young <i>Pinus ponderosa</i>, along with <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> on moist sites (Reid et al. 1999).<br /><br />A meeting of Pacific Northwest ecologists for Landfire concluded that the \"true savannas\" of high-frequency / low-intensity fires and grassy understories are now rare in the central and northern Rocky Mountains. Most areas that may have been savanna in the past are now more nearly closed-canopy woodlands/forests. Louisa Evers (pers. comm. 2006) notes that she has not found any evidence that ponderosa pine savanna existed historically in north-central and central Oregon. In north-central Oregon, the savanna would have been oak or pine-oak. In central Oregon, it may well have been western juniper. Condition surveys of the Cascades Forest Reserve and General Land Office survey notes suggest that ponderosa pine formed a woodland with grassy understories, but still was often referred to as open-parklike.<br /><br />In mixed stands of <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> and <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>, presettlement fire regimes may have been characterized by frequent, low-intensity surface fires that maintained relatively open stands of a mix of fire-resistant species. Under present conditions, the fire regime is mixed-severity and more variable, with stand-replacing fires more common, and the forests are more homogeneous. With vigorous fire suppression, longer fire-return intervals are now the rule, and multi-layered stands of <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pinus ponderosa</i>, and/or <i>Abies grandis</i> provide fuel \"ladders,\" making these forests more susceptible to high-intensity, stand-replacing fires. They are productive forests which have been priorities for timber production.<br /><br />Successional relationships in the middle Rocky Mountain <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> forests are complex. <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> is less shade-tolerant than many northern or montane trees such as <i>Tsuga heterophylla, Abies concolor, Picea engelmannii</i>, or <i>Thuja plicata</i>, and seedlings compete poorly in deep shade. At drier locales, seedlings may be favored by moderate shading, such as by a canopy of <i>Pinus ponderosa</i>, which helps to minimize drought stress. In some locations, much of these forests were logged or burned during European settlement, and present-day stands are second-growth forests dating from fire, logging, or other stand-replacing disturbances (Mauk and Henderson 1984). <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> forests were probably subject to a moderate-severity fire regime in presettlement times, with fire-return intervals of 30-100 years. Many of the important tree species in these forests are fire-adapted (<i>Populus tremuloides, Pinus ponderosa, Pinus contorta</i>) (Pfister et al. 1977), and fire-induced reproduction of <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> can result in its continued codominance in <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> forests (Steele et al. 1981). Seeds of the shrub <i>Ceanothus velutinus</i> can remain dormant in forest stands for 200 years (Steele et al. 1981) and germinate abundantly after fire, competitively suppressing conifer seedlings. Some stands may have higher tree-stem density than historically, due largely to fire suppression.<br /><br />Marriot and Faber-Langendoen (2000) report different fire regimes for ponderosa pine communities in the Black Hills, with their \"Dry Group\" more typically having frequent surface fires and the \"Mesic Group\" having infrequent catastrophic fires (every 100-200 years). The Dry Group of associations includes lower elevation foothill savanna associations, and the mesic group somewhat higher elevation, north-slope, swale associations. Kelly Kindscher (pers. comm. 2007) believes that almost all of the stands in Nebraska were there at the time of settlement and are not a result of pine expansion due to fire suppression; in addition, at least some have disappeared, such as the one in southern Nebraska (Franklin County). It is possible, however, that some areas of Great Plains ponderosa have expanded in size due to fire suppression, but this needs substantiation.',\n",
       "    'Floristics': 'In the northwestern Great Plains, the tree canopy is primarily dominated by <i>Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum</i> but may include a sparse to relatively dense understory of <i>Juniperus scopulorum</i> or <i>Cercocarpus</i> with just a few scattered trees. Deciduous trees are an important component in some areas (western Dakotas, Black Hills) and are sometimes codominant with the pines, including <i>Acer negundo, Betula papyrifera, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Populus tremuloides, Quercus macrocarpa</i>, and <i>Ulmus americana</i>. Important or common shrub species with ponderosa pine can include <i>Amelanchier alnifolia, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Juniperus communis, Juniperus horizontalis, Mahonia repens, Physocarpus monogynus, Prunus virginiana, Rhus trilobata, Symphoricarpos</i> spp., and <i>Yucca glauca</i>. The herbaceous understory is variable and can range from a sparse to dense layer with species typifying the surrounding prairie group, with mixedgrass species common, such as <i>Andropogon gerardii, Bouteloua curtipendula, Carex inops ssp. heliophila, Carex filifolia, Koeleria macrantha, Nassella viridula, Oryzopsis asperifolia, Pascopyrum smithii, Piptatheropsis micrantha (= Piptatherum micranthum)</i>, and <i>Schizachyrium scoparium</i>. Higher-elevation stands often have herbaceous species more typical of the Rocky Mountains such as <i>Achillea millefolium, Antennaria rosea, Balsamorhiza sagittata, Cerastium arvense, Danthonia intermedia, Fragaria</i> spp., <i>Galium boreale, Pulsatilla patens</i>, and <i>Lathyrus ochroleucus</i>.<br /><br />Further west, <i>Pinus ponderosa</i>-dominated woodlands include two physiognomic phases: true woodlands of <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> with shrubby or grassy understories, and \"wooded steppes\" with widely spaced, scattered <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> trees over generally shrubby but sparse understories. The former are generally fire-maintained, while the later are often too dry and with widely spaced vegetation to carry fire. <i>Pinus ponderosa var. ponderosa</i> is the predominant conifer (west of the Continental Divide); <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> or <i>Pinus flexilis</i> may be present in the tree canopy but are usually absent. The understory can be shrubby, with <i>Amelanchier alnifolia, Arctostaphylos patula, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Ceanothus velutinus, Cercocarpus ledifolius, Physocarpus malvaceus, Purshia tridentata, Rosa</i> spp., <i>Symphoricarpos oreophilus</i> or <i>Symphoricarpos albus</i>, and <i>Vaccinium cespitosum</i> common species. In transition areas with big sagebrush steppe, <i>Artemisia arbuscula, Artemisia tridentata ssp. tridentata, Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis, Artemisia tripartita</i>, and <i>Purshia tridentata</i> may be common in fire-protected sites such as rocky areas. Deciduous shrubs, such as <i>Physocarpus malvaceus, Symphoricarpos albus</i>, or <i>Spiraea betulifolia</i>, can be abundant in more northerly sites or more moist climates. Understory vegetation in the true savanna occurrences is predominantly fire-resistant grasses and forbs that resprout following surface fires; shrubs, understory trees and downed logs are uncommon. These more open stands support grasses such as <i>Achnatherum</i> spp., dry <i>Carex</i> species (<i>Carex inops</i>), <i>Festuca campestris, Festuca idahoensis, Hesperostipa</i> spp., or <i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>. More mesic sites may include <i>Calamagrostis rubescens</i> or <i>Carex geyeri</i>, species more typical of the higher elevation Douglas-fir - pine forests.<br /><br />In the Central Rockies forests are typically dominated by a mix of <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> and <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> in the tree canopy, although either can be absent. Other seral trees may occur, including <i>Pinus contorta, Pinus monticola</i>, and <i>Larix occidentalis</i> (neither in central Montana). <i>Picea engelmannii</i> (or <i>Picea glauca</i> or their hybrid) becomes increasingly common to the east. In the eastern Cascades, <i>Pinus contorta</i> may be the codominant pine, rather than <i>Pinus ponderosa</i>. <i>Abies grandis</i> (a fire-sensitive, shade-tolerant species not occurring in central Montana) has increased on many sites once dominated by <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> and <i>Pinus ponderosa</i>, which were formerly maintained by low-severity wildfire. <i>Abies concolor</i> and <i>Abies grandis x concolor</i> hybrids in central Idaho (the Salmon Mountains) may occur in some stands, but have very restricted ranges in this area. <i>Abies concolor</i> and <i>Abies grandis</i> in the Blue Mountains of Oregon are probably hybrids of the two and mostly <i>Abies grandis</i>. Understories are typically dominated by graminoids, such as <i>Calamagrostis rubescens, Carex geyeri, Carex rossii</i>, and <i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>, and a variety of shrubs, such as <i>Acer glabrum, Juniperus communis, Physocarpus malvaceus, Symphoricarpos albus, Spiraea betulifolia</i>, or <i>Vaccinium membranaceum</i> on mesic sites.<br /><br />The foothill-rock outcrop limber pine - juniper woodlands are dominated by <i>Pinus flexilis, Juniperus osteosperma</i>, or <i>Juniperus scopulorum</i>. <i>Pinus edulis</i> is not present. A sparse to moderately dense short-shrub layer, if present, may include a variety of shrubs, such as <i>Artemisia nova, Artemisia tridentata, Cercocarpus ledifolius, Cercocarpus montanus, Ericameria nauseosa, Juniperus horizontalis, Purshia tridentata, Rhus trilobata</i>, or <i>Rosa woodsii</i>. Herbaceous layers are generally sparse, but range to moderately dense, and are typically dominated by perennial graminoids such as <i>Bouteloua gracilis, Hesperostipa comata, Koeleria macrantha, Leymus innovatus</i> (in Alberta), <i>Piptatheropsis micrantha, Poa secunda, Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>, or <i>Schizachyrium scoparium</i>.<br /><br />In the middle Rocky Mountains are found extensive <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> forests, occasionally with <i>Pinus flexilis</i> on calcareous substrates, and <i>Pinus contorta</i> at higher elevations. True firs, such as <i>Abies concolor, Abies grandis</i>, and <i>Abies lasiocarpa</i>, are generally absent in these occurrences, but <i>Picea engelmannii</i> can occur in some stands. <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> is also not common in this region. Understory components include shrubs such as <i>Amelanchier alnifolia, Juniperus communis, Linnaea borealis, Mahonia repens, Physocarpus malvaceus, Purshia tridentata, Spiraea betulifolia, Symphoricarpos oreophilus</i>, and <i>Symphoricarpos albus</i>. Common graminoids include <i>Calamagrostis rubescens, Carex rossii</i>, and <i>Leucopoa kingii</i>. Forbs are variable, but typical taxa include <i>Arnica cordifolia, Osmorhiza berteroi, Thalictrum occidentale, Viola adunca</i>, and species of many other genera, including <i>Arenaria, Erigeron, Fragaria, Galium, Lathyrus, Lupinus, Penstemon, Vicia</i>, and others. These Douglas-fir forests often occur at the lower treeline immediately above valley grasslands, or sagebrush steppe and shrublands. Sometimes there may be a \"bath-tub ring\" of <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> at lower elevations or <i>Pinus flexilis</i> between the valley non-forested and the solid <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> forest. In the Wyoming Basins, there are isolated stands of <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>, with <i>Artemisia tridentata, Pseudoroegneria spicata, Leucopoa kingii</i>, and <i>Carex rossii</i>.',\n",
       "    'Physiognomy and Structure': 'These are physiognomically variable conifer forests, woodlands or savannas, ranging from very sparse patches of trees on drier sites, to nearly closed-canopy forest stands on north slopes or in draws where available soil moisture is higher. They can have grassy or shrubby understories. In places these are patchy woodlands dominated by relatively short conifers (scrub woodlands). Occasionally broad-leaved deciduous trees are intermixed with the conifers in mesic settings, or as seral components. Shrubs can be broad-leaved deciduous, or needle-leaved or microphyllous evergreen (sagebrush), while the graminoids are primarily bunch grasses, along with rhizomatous grasses. Understories are generally low to moderate in cover, especially in the most droughty and rocky sites. In some cases due to a climate-edaphic interaction, the structure is that of widely scattered trees over \"shrub-steppe\" of <i>Artemisia</i> spp., <i>Purshia tridentata</i>, or sparsely distributed grasses.'},\n",

Occurrences of <i>Larix occidentalis </i>stands are generated by stand-replacing fire, the fire-return interval for which is speculated to be approximately 80 to 200 years (Cooper et al. 1987). These sites may be maintained in a seral status for hundreds of years since <i>Larix occidentalis</i> is a long-lived species and the understory is often dominated by <i>Pseudotsuga</i>, which will grow into the upper canopy. The potential dominants, typically <i>Abies lasiocarpa, Picea engelmannii</i>, and/or <i>Abies grandis </i>or rarely <i>Tsuga heterophylla</i> or <i>Thuja plicata</i>, establish and grow on these sites, presenting the distinct probability, given the fire-return intervals for this type, that the \"climax\" (long-term stable) condition is never attained. It has been noted in northern Idaho that, following disturbance (particularly logging) in some mesic-site occurrences, <i>Larix occidentalis</i> does not necessarily replace itself, the first tree-dominated successional stages being dominated by <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pinus contorta</i>, or less frequently by more shade-tolerant species (Cooper et al. 1987); this response is a consequence of the episodic nature of favorable cone crop years in <i>Larix occidentalis</i>.',\n",
       "    'Floristics': '<i>Abies grandis</i> is dominant in these forests and <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> commonly shares the canopy. <i>Pinus monticola, Picea engelmannii, Pinus contorta, Abies lasiocarpa</i>, and <i>Larix occidentalis</i> are major associates. On most mesic sites, intermediate to older age stands of this forest group may support some <i>Thuja plicata</i> and <i>Tsuga heterophylla</i> in the overstory. Common shrubs include <i>Paxistima myrsinites, Amelanchier alnifolia, Rosa gymnocarpa, Acer glabrum, Spiraea betulifolia, Symphoricarpos albus, Cornus canadensis, Rubus parviflorus, Menziesia ferruginea, Taxus brevifolia</i>, and <i>Vaccinium membranaceum</i>. Composition of the herbaceous layer reflects local climate and degree of canopy closure; it is typically highly diverse in all but closed-canopy conditions. <i>Clintonia uniflora, Linnaea borealis, Aralia nudicaulis</i>, and <i>Xerophyllum tenax</i> are common forbs in these forests. Other forbs include <i>Actaea rubra, Adenocaulon bicolor, Arnica latifolia, Galium triflorum, Goodyera oblongifolia, Orthilia secunda, Streptopus amplexifolius, Prosartes hookeri (= Disporum hookeri), Thalictrum occidentale</i>, and <i>Trillium ovatum</i>. <i>Asarum caudatum</i> occurs in the Kootenai and Yak river areas of extreme northwestern Montana, north-central Idaho and in the Blue Mountains in Oregon. Graminoids usually form a very minor component and typically include <i>Bromus vulgaris</i> and minor amounts of <i>Carex geyeri, Elymus glaucus, Festuca subulata</i>, and <i>Oryzopsis asperifolia</i>. This group also includes woodlands or \"savannas\" of the deciduous conifer <i>Larix occidentalis</i>. Important low-growing shrubs include <i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Spiraea betulifolia</i>, and <i>Vaccinium cespitosum</i>; taller shrubs can include <i>Acer glabrum, Ceanothus velutinus, Shepherdia canadensis, Physocarpus malvaceus, Rubus parviflorus</i>, or <i>Vaccinium membranaceum</i>. Herbaceous species include <i>Calamagrostis rubescens, Clintonia uniflora, Linnaea borealis</i>, or <i>Xerophyllum tenax</i>.',\n",
