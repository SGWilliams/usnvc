I played around with adding a little bit of value to the nations structure by looking up names and setting up objects that contain name, abbreviation, uncertainty (true/false), and an info API reference. But I also kept the original raw string/list of national abbreviations. That process would be a lot smarter if I did it here by pulling together a distinct list of all referenced nation codes/abbreviations and then building a lookup dataframe on those. I'll revisit at some point or if the code bogs down, but the REST API call is pretty quick."

       "  'Overview': {'Classification Comments': 'Plantations, ruderal, and native forest and woodland stands are typically placed in this class. Some plantation forests can be placed here rather than in <i>7. ~Agricultural & Developed Vegetation Cultural Class (CCL01)$$</i> despite having a canopy layer that may be very regular (spaced in planted rows), if the tree regeneration, shrub and ground layers develop spontaneously with irregular horizontal spacing, similar to native forests (i.e., regular human intervention does not occur for these layers). However, where plantations have highly regular horizontal structure, with regular human intervention in all layers (e.g., through cutting, spraying, ground-layer mowing), they may better be placed in <i>7. ~Agricultural & Developed Vegetation Cultural Class (CCL01)$$</i>.<br /><br />Similarly, tree-dominated vegetation that has a natural, irregular horizontal spacing in the tree layer, but highly regular shrub or herb layers because of human intervention, should be placed in <i>7. ~Agricultural & Developed Vegetation Cultural Class (CCL01)$$</i>. For example, shade coffee, cacao, and other woody agricultural crops grown under native (or exotic) tree species and in which all non-treed strata layers are subject to regular human intervention should be placed in that class.<br /><br />Included in this class are low-statured trees that overtop other growth forms. These include tree sapling and seedling stands with trees <2 m, where the tree growth form is at least 10% cover and overtops other growth forms. These include subarctic woodlands and coastal dwarf-tree woodlands that are <2 m but are single-stemmed with definite crowns. Conversely, treed bogs and fens, with low stunted trees and conical canopies, and otherwise sharing the moss and dwarf-shrub layers of open bogs and fens, are placed with those types. Where trees share the same strata as grasslands and shrublands (e.g., tallgrass brush prairie of 1-3 m, with trees <2 m), the vegetation is placed in the shrub- and herb-dominated classes.<br /><br />Tree cover ranges from 10-100%, and is inclusive of what are called forests, woodlands, and tree savannas, at least in the non-tropical regions. The class limit of 10% tree cover (for mesomorphic tree growth forms) follows that of FAO\\'s Global Forest Resources Assessment 2000 (FAO 2001). We exclude stands of trees planted primarily for agricultural production (such as fruit tree or forest plantations) and typically agroforestry, as well as those in developed lands, such as cities and roadsides (they are placed in Class 7, Formation 7.A.2). However, unlike FAO, we do not include what FAO calls \"temporarily unstocked areas\" (such as clearcuts, burnt areas) unless the tree growth form is actually present at 10% cover--even if in seedling or sapling form--and exceeds the height of other growth forms.<br /><br />Other classifications may limit forests and woodland to a narrower range of tree cover. For example, forests and woodlands are sometimes defined as 25-100% cover, and distinguished from tree savannas with 10-25% cover which are included under broadly defined grassland and shrubland classes (Driscoll et al. 1984, FGDC 1997, Grossman et al. 1998, Minnesota DNR 2005b). UNESCO (1973) required that tree savannas have a strong herbaceous layer (>50% graminoid cover). Still, a variety of definitions of tree savanna have been published, from the 10-25% cover noted above, to 10-30% cover in Nelson (2005), 10-40% in UNESCO (1973), and 10-50% cover in Curtis (1959). Blue oak, Engelmann oak, and other woodlands in California Mediterranean woodlands are typically between 10 and 60% cover, and California State ecologists place these in Forest & Woodland (Barbour et al. 2007). However, apart from tree savannas, there are many other forest and woodland types and regions where the degree of canopy closure plays less of a role in defining types, for example, forested swamps and bogs, longleaf pine woodlands (Peet 2006), eastern pine barrens, and subarctic woodlands.<br /><br />Thus, given the variety of situations, we have chosen a more inclusive definition of forest and woodland that encompasses most tree savanna concepts, and rely on lower levels of the hierarchy to make distinctions based on a combination of biogeography, ecology, and floristics. For example, in the context of the eastern Great Plains tallgrass prairie-forest border, it is common to recognize oak savannas, based on open tree cover levels (e.g., 5-30% tree cover in Nelson 2005), as separate from oak woodlands (30-80% cover) and oak forests (80-100% cover). Savannas may be distinguished from forests or woodlands, but these structural distinctions often correspond to lower-level units of the NVC hierarchy (e.g., group, alliance, and association). Still, Dixon et al. (2014) and others suggest that there may be good ecological reasons to treat upland tropical tree savannas, with 10-40% tree cover, trees <8 m tall, and a substantial graminoid layer as part of <i>2. ~Shrub & Herb Vegetation Class (C02)$$</i>, and we allow for that option here.',\n",

       "  'Overview': {'Classification Comments': 'This class includes both non-treed grasslands and shrublands, and open tree savannas, where tree canopy cover is typically <10%. Non-tropical tree savannas, defined by a strong graminoid layer (>50% in UNESCO 1973) and some level of open tree cover (10-25% cover in UNESCO (1973), 10-30% cover in Nelson (2005), 10-50% cover in Curtis (1959)), often closely resemble open upland grasslands and shrublands, especially in grassland regions. Thus, in this particular realm of vegetation, the open tree canopy, in combination with the ground layer, helps define savanna vegetation, distinct from forests or woodlands (e.g., Nelson 2005). But in many other regions and vegetation types (e.g., forested swamps and bogs, longleaf pine woodlands (Peet 2006), California oak woodlands (Barbour et al. 2007), subarctic woodlands), the role of canopy closure varies. Thus, in non-tropical regions, we generally place tree savannas, where trees >5 m have >10% cover, with woodland and forest. However, as Dixon et al. (2014) and others suggest, there may be good ecological reasons to treat upland tropical tree savannas, with up to 40% tree cover, trees <8 m tall, and a substantial graminoid layer, as part of <i>2. ~Shrub & Herb Vegetation Class (C02)$$</i>, and we allow for that option here.<br /><br />Croplands with a spontaneous ground layer of \"weeds,\" where the annual rotation of crops prevents a persistent ground layer of herbs, are treated in <i>7. ~Agricultural & Developed Vegetation Cultural Class (CCL01)$$</i>. If agricultural practices are abandoned, these sites may succeed to more persistent \"ruderal\" grasslands and shrublands (and forests) and would be placed in this class.<br /><br />Where grasses and shrubs overtop low trees (\"brush prairie\"), the stands are placed here in Shrub & Herb Vegetation. These situations may often occur in grassland or cool semi-desert regions (e.g., North American Great Plains or Great Basin). Also challenging are some scrub trees, such as juniper (<i>Juniperus</i> spp.) or mesquite (<i>Prosopis</i> spp.), which can form shrub-like stands, and are typically <5 m tall at maturity in parts of their range. Where forms are not easily defined, woody plants equal to or >5 m at maturity are considered trees (FGDC 2008). In the United States, there are shrubby junipers (<i>Juniperus communis, Juniperus pinchotii</i>) that should be treated as shrubs. But pygmy conifers can potentially make 5 m and are treated as trees (<i>Pinus edulis, Juniperus scopulorum, Juniperus monosperma, Juniperus occidentalis, Juniperus osteosperma</i>).<br /><br />There is a group of ephemerals that are generally mesomorphic, which can, under optimal rainfall conditions, grow on sand, including desert sands and pavement. They are adapted to deserts through their seed characteristics. Typically they do not occupy extensive deep shifting sands, only margins of sandsheets and more stable sands. They rely on seedbanks that may persist for decades in the sand and germinate under optimal winter or summer episodes of heavy rains. These are treated here as part of the mesomorphic shrub and herb class. Examples of psammophytic species include some sand verbenas (<i>Abronia</i> spp.) and several Asteraceae (e.g., <i>Dicoria canescens, Palafoxia</i> spp., etc.).',\n",

Some judgment is required to ensure how to sample and classify vegetation in stands where there is <1% vascular plant cover in parts, but not all, of the stand. That is, some deserts may have only patchy non-vegetated areas, whereas others may have extensive non-vegetated areas. More work is needed to define xeromorphic herbaceous growth forms, such as ephemerals, that may appear under rare high-precipitation years.<br /><br />Semi-desert grasslands may be hard to identify in this class when woody plants are absent or uncommon, because there are no herbaceous growth forms currently recognized that are diagnostic for the xeromorphic class. Desert grasses may be xerophytic but not clearly xeromorphic. However, in many cases they will have strong floristic similarity to open desert shrublands and, if degraded, may be dominated by desert shrubs. More work is needed to determine if such growth forms can be specified (e.g., desert-blooming ephemerals).',\n",

Drought-deciduous, including facultatively drought-deciduous, trees may be present. Other characteristics include opportunistic leaf-flush (e.g., ocotillo), high incidence of energy allocation to protective structures such as spines, and allocation to heat- or moisture-loss structures. The various herb growth forms currently recognized in FGDC (2008) are not exclusive to the xeromorphic class, and more work is needed to assess whether additional herbaceous growth form types should be recognized that may be distinctive for this class. For example, Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) physiology is common in desert plants, especially among succulents.<br /><br />In addition some desert vegetation has biological crust, comprised of soil particles, cyanobacteria, algae, microfungi, lichens, and bryophytes. The crusts do not develop under a closed canopy of vascular plants. They do occur in all climates following disturbance of that cover. However, the most conspicuous development of crusts occurs in hot, cool, and cold semi-arid and arid areas where plants are widely spaced.<br /><br /><i>Structure</i>: Stands are very open and have irregular shrub or herb horizontal stem spacing, often with prominent non-vegetated surfaces. Xeromorphic trees are present, occasionally moderately dense (10-60%). There is <10% cover of mesomorphic trees, and xeromorphic tree, shrub and/or herb growth forms have the majority of cover compared to mesomorphic or cryomorphic shrubs or herbs. Tree cover varies from sparse to moderately closed (1% to >60% cover). Nonvascular and dwarf-shrub growth forms may vary from 0 to 100%.

Review is needed on the placement of páramo and puna in South America. Currently only super-páramo and higher elevation puna are placed here, as this class is restricted to the more strongly cryomorphic high montane forms of puna and páramos (e.g., in Venezuela there are stands dominated by cryomorphic growth forms but lack the typical grass cover). This is because lower elevation páramo and moist puna have mesomorphic grasses covering the ground (often exceeding 80% cover), whereas cryomorphic shrubs and herbs, although present and conspicuous, may be <20% cover. These lower elevation stands also lack any cryoturbation. Using these criteria, we would place these lower elevation stands in the mesomorphic \"Tropical Montane Grassland & Shrubland\" formation. On the other hand, we don\\'t yet have a working set of \"cryomorphic herbs\" versus \"mesomorphic herb\" growth forms so it is hard to know how to weigh the presence of these mesomorphic herbs against the cryomorphic shrubs. Consistent placement of the subalpine and alpine zones across tropical, temperate and boreal regions is needed.',\n",

       "  'Overview': {'Classification Comments': 'This class is defined by primarily nonvascular, often crustose lichen, ferns or very sparse other vascular vegetation that is controlled by the rocky substrate. The substrate can be classed as either stable (large boulders, outcrops, monoliths, etc.) or unstable (colluvium such as scree, talus or dense, alluvial cobble). Stable substrates prevent vascular plant roots from penetrating. Species adapted to such substrates have no roots and occupy the surface of the substrates, such as nonvasculars (lichens, mosses, liverworts), or are largely prevented from growing on the substrate, except in localized fissures or cracks. Whenever the vegetation is able to establish sufficient cover on the rocky surface (typically >10% cover), the growth forms of the vegetation determine the class. Vascular spore-bearing plants (ferns and others) are included in this class. Spikemoss (<i>Selaginella</i>) regularly adheres to cliff and outcrops, as do many species of ferns such as <i>Polypodium, Cheilanthes, Pellaea</i>, etc.<br /><br />Lithology may be consolidated or unconsolidated, but the conditions of the substrate preclude development of soil and either strongly impede the penetration of roots or require specialized adaptations of roots to support the plant species. Lithomorphic Vegetation may be similar to desert or polar types where climate <i>per se</i> limits the overall plant growth, and substrate limitations are secondary.<br /><br />Open sand dunes are excluded from this class in general as open sand dunes are an extreme condition of other classes (i.e., mesomorphic, xeromorphic), where the constant movement of sand (ablation, deposition, etc.) is at too extreme a pace for even the typical adaptations of psammophytic plants, such as creeping stolons, rhizomes, etc., to keep up.<br /><br />Larson et al. (2000b) characterize cliffs as having a \"high, steep, or overhanging face of rock,\" whereas rock outcrop is a \"portion of bedrock protruding through the soil.\" Lava flows and colluvial deposits would lay over the soil. They include both consolidated and unconsolidated cliffs in their definition, including sand, gravel or loess, as well as rock cliffs. Here we restrict it to rock (or at least very rocklike) materials. Apart from stating that a cliff need only be \"high enough that falling off will kill you,\" they suggest that even 3 m of height is sufficient to create suitable cliff habitat.<br /><br />Defining this class to include sparse vascular vegetation stands that are limited in their cover because of substrate is an issue. For example, scree vegetation could be considered very similar to psammophytic (dune and other sandy) vegetation and be treated as an extreme form of mesomorphic vegetation [mostly or all in <i>2. ~Shrub & Herb Vegetation Class (C02)$$</i>]. Scree is usually dominated by sparse vascular plants, has considerable soil development for vascular plant establishment, but has unstable substrate on which nonvascular vegetation cannot become well-established (C. Lea pers. comm. 2012). However, whereas dunes can have vegetation that greatly exceeds 10% cover, this is less common on scree; by-and-large, the vascular vegetation remains sparse, and nonvascular vegetation is typical. Talus is generally stable enough that it has significant nonvascular vegetation, whereas scree may be unstable and less commonly contains a strong nonvascular component; further review of this distinction is needed. Thus talus fits in this Open Rock Vegetation Class based on the nonvascular vegetation criteria, and scree fits in this class because of the sparse vascular vegetation, perhaps in combination with nonvascular vegetation.<br /><br />Further review may suggest that this class can be improved by distinguishing (probably at the subclass level), the less \"rocklike\" vegetation (including vegetation on scree, badlands, pavement) from the true solid rock vegetation (C. Lea pers. comm. 2012). Scree and other loose rocky substrates (volcanic cinders) typically have enough soil development to support a dominant layer of disturbance-adapted, facultative mesomorphic shrubs and/or herbs (e.g., in the United States, <i>Ribes</i> spp., <i>Prunus virginiana</i>, and other forest, woodland, or shrubland shrubs in the central Rockies), and true lithomorphs (saxicolous lichens) are quite sparse, if present at all. Although the surface may be \"rocky,\" the driving ecological factor is the availability of soil in quantity under the relatively shallow rock armoring and the absence of large, stable substrates for true lithomorphs (saxicolous lichens) to establish. Cobbles along rivers and streams may also not typically support lithomorphic growth forms, and may best be treated as sometimes sparse flooded types within mesomorphic formations. Badlands (hard clays) and desert pavements also tend to support facultative vascular species, as opposed to lithomorphs or lithophiles, and could be considered for the xeromorphic class. Given this narrower definition of open rock vegetation, a requirement for <10% vascular cover and nonvascular cover greater than vascular cover may be more appropriate, to separate them from sparse or occasionally sparse types (scree, volcanic cinders) in which vascular layers are clearly dominant and lithomorphic nonvascular is insignificant (C. Lea pers. comm. 2012).',\n",

Tropical dry forest (sometimes called Tropical Dry Forest & Woodland or Tropical Seasonally Dry Forest) range in canopy types, including evergreen, semi-evergreen (needle-leaved or broad-leaved), or largely or wholly deciduous. Tree growth forms predominate and may be species-rich, with micro- to mesophyll leaves, but succulent species may be present. It occurs in humid dry tropical climates with a pronounced dry season, during which some or all of the trees may lose their leaves, or leaves may be moderately small and evergreen sclerophyllous. Canopy heights decrease and canopy coverage tends to decrease as the climate dries until the forests are reduced to open, short-statured (5-15 m) woodlands.<br /><br />Tropical humid forests (including moist and wet forests) occur in the humid tropics where rainfall varies from abundant and well-distributed throughout the year to somewhat seasonal. Tree growth forms predominate, are tall, often of numerous species, some with buttressed bases, often smooth bark, and evergreen meso- to macrophyll leaves. Also present may be tree ferns, large woody climbers or lianas, and both vascular and nonvascular epiphytes, often of greater diversity than the ground layer. Heights may exceed 30 m. Tropical forested wetlands include swamps and mangroves, where soils are seasonally or permanently saturated to inundated by freshwater or saltwater, with hydrophytic plants and, in the case of mangrove, distinctive hydromorphic growth forms adapted to saline conditions.',\n",

       "  'Overview': {'Classification Comments': 'Warm-temperate forests and woodlands are defined here to include both the classic Mediterranean forests and woodlands and the more humid warm-temperate forests. Both share increasing levels of broad-leaved evergreen trees, including sclerophyllous-leaved trees, as well as evergreen shrubs and herbs, as compared to other temperate forests and woodlands. Walter (1985) recognizes two warm-temperate biomes, the \"Zonobiome of the Winter-Rain Region with an Arid-Humid Climate and Sclerophyllic Woodlands\" (Zone IV) and the \"Zonobiome of the Warm-Temperate Humid Climate\" (Zone V), distinct from the cool-temperate biome \"Zonobiome of the Temperate-Nemoral Climate\" (Zone VI) and the boreal biome \"Zonobiome of the Cold-Temperate Boreal Climate\" (Zone VIII). Schultz (1995) also recognizes the two warm-temperate regions, which he refers to as: \"Mediterranean-Type subtropics\" (with world distribution shown in his Figure 129) and \"Humid subtropics\" (with world distribution shown in his Figure 171).',\n",

       "   'Type Concept': 'Temperate & Boreal Forest & Woodland is typically dominated by broad-leaved deciduous and needle-leaved trees, with some broad-leaved evergreens in warmer regions. It is found across the globe typically between 25° and 60-70°N and S latitude, but is far more abundant in the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere. The climate varies from warm-temperate with only rare frosts and snow to cold subarctic conditions. The gradation from warm-temperate (including Mediterranean) to boreal vegetation is often subtle and occurs across broad regions, so they are treated together as one subclass (Table 1).<br /><br />Temperate & Boreal Forest & Woodland includes temperate rainforest, temperate deciduous forest and woodland, and temperate evergreen forest and woodland. These forests are dominated by broad-leaved or needle-leaved growth forms. Trees typically range in height from 10 to 30 m, but rainforest trees may attain great height, exceeding 50 m. Temperate broad-leaved deciduous and needle-leaved forests grow in cool-temperate climates, with summer rainfall and cold winters (during which the broad-leaved trees lose their leaves), extending to the treeline of temperate regions, where they resemble boreal forests. Temperate broad-leaved evergreen forests, often mixed with broad-leaved deciduous and needle-leaved trees, occur in warm-temperate climates, with either mild winters and moist, warm summers, or winter-rain winters and dry, warm summers (Mediterranean).<br /><br />Boreal Forest & Woodland contains primarily needle-leaved evergreen trees, with or without boreal broad-leaved deciduous trees. Structure varies from tall, closed-canopy (but rarely exceeding 15 m) to open, low (<5 m) subarctic and boreal subalpine woodlands at treeline. Nonvascular mosses and lichens may predominate in the ground layer. Winters are very cold and vary from arid to moist. Temperate high montane forest may resemble boreal forest.

In tropical mountains, surface layers that freeze may overlie unfrozen subsurface layers. An important effect of frost-heaving is the upward movement of stones in soils and unconsolidated deposits that is more rapid and pervasive in wetter soils with a sparse vegetation cover.

       "  'Overview': {'Classification Comments': 'The páramo and the dry and moist puna are not included in this subclass, because they have primarily mesomorphic adaptations, and because the soils are not subject to cryogenic processes. These vegetation types are treated with <i>2.A.2 ~Tropical Montane Grassland & Shrubland Formation (F017)$$</i>. Nonetheless, although the páramo and the dry and moist puna are not subject to cryogenic soil processes, they are subject to varying levels of freezing. Perhaps the term \"cryomorphic\" places too great a restriction on the concept of \"tropical alpine\" vegetation.<br /><br />Also challenging to place consistently in this class is the South American xerophytic vegetation of the Altiplano region of central and southern Bolivia, northern Argentina, and Chile, because the cryomorphic definition is very similar to xeromorphic; that is to say, they share ecological processes and have similar structures (growth forms) to each other. The vegetation is not Cool Semi-Desert, but is a hot/cold semi-desert, while at the same time is hardly affected by edaphic processes of cryoturbation and geliturbation expected of the cryomorphic class. We find again the diurnal rhythm of ice/thaw of the tropical mountains, but it is marked in these high dry southern areas with very high daily solar temperatures and very low nocturnal temperatures. For example, in the Great Salt Flats of Uyuni (Salar de Uyuni) to 3800 m of altitude, during the day temperatures can rise to 20°C and at night to -20°C. This is an extreme case related to the immense salt flats, but the lands that surround them repeat almost the same features listed above, although with smaller thermal amplitudes (C. Josse pers. comm. 2011). So high-elevation semi-deserts share some characteristics with the tropical high montane vegetation.',\n",

       "  'Distribution': {'Geographic Range': 'Temperate to Polar Alpine &amp; Tundra Vegetation occurs above treeline in temperate and boreal regions around the globe, predominantly in North America and Eurasia, with more isolated occurrences in the Southern Hemisphere. Polar tundra is dominated by complex patterns of dominance by dwarf-shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses and lichens, and is found in the high latitudes north of 60°N in the Arctic region and south of 50°S in the Antarctic region, where climatic conditions exclude tree and tall-shrub growth forms.'},\n",
       "  'Environment': {'Environmental Description': 'Alpine vegetation occurs above the treeline. Treeline varies depending on latitude and the \"mountain mass\" (i.e., large mountain masses retain more heat and tend to have higher treeline elevations, whereas smaller and more isolated mountain masses tend to have lower treeline elevations). In addition to elevation, exposure to wind is a key factor in the type of vegetation; in snowy regions, it impacts on the depth and duration of snow cover and, hence, protection of the vegetation, length of growing season, and soil moisture conditions.<br /><br /><i>Climate:</i> For alpine vegetation, the \"tundra\" climate of high altitudes does not necessarily correspond to that of high latitudes (i.e., Arctic tundra). Although both regions have low mean annual temperature and short growing seasons, and experience a seasonal change in sun angle (high in the summer, low in the winter), the light regimes are quite different. Alpine regions never experience 24 hours of day or night; day length varies with latitude. And although permafrost occurs on high mountains, it does not produce the kinds of landforms found in the Arctic because few flat sites are available. Conversely, avalanches and rockslides are common in alpine regions, but do not occur in the Arctic (Quinn 2008). Some alpine regions can have very deep snow (several meters), whereas the Arctic generally has low snow cover.<br /><br />Temperatures in the Arctic and Antarctic vary with the season, which has periods of 24-hour light (summer) and dark (winter). The number of days with those extremes varies with latitude, ranging from 1 day at the Arctic and Antarctic circles (66½°N and S latitude) to 6 months at the poles. Temperatures vary both with latitude and degree of continentality. Mean temperatures of the warmest summer months vary considerably but generally average between 4.5° and 13°C. In the winter, they average from -20° to -30°C. Annual precipitation, which often falls as snow, is typically <25 cm, but some localities may have as much as 50 cm.<br /><br /><i>Soil/substrate/hydrology</i>: Most alpine soils are regularly disturbed by freezing, erosion and downslope slides, and contain a mix of rocks and fine particles (Quinn 2008). Three major types of soils occur in the alpine regions: (1) Poorly developed rocky or stony soils (or Entisols) are sometimes called Lithosols when formed on bare rock of slopes and ridges and Regosols when formed on unconsolidated rock-like talus, scree, or rubble (soil orders from Soil Survey Staff (1999)) [see Brady and Weil (2002) for comparison of U.S. soil orders with Canadian and FAO systems]. Both types are shallow, dry and azonal. (2) Alpine turf and meadow soils (or Inceptisols) are up to 75 cm deep and exhibit distinct horizons; and (3) bog soils (Histosols) are found in depressions or where seepage saturates the ground to a depth of 1 m or more (Quinn 2008).<br /><br />In many polar tundra areas, the deep layers of the soil are permanently frozen (permafrost), and only the surface layer is thawed and becomes biologically active during the summer (Whittaker 1975). Soils may be dry to seasonally saturated. Permafrost is ground that is permanently frozen, and is widespread in the Arctic, covering large parts of Canada and Russia. It is discontinuous in the Boreal Forest & Woodland region to the south. It can extend down more than 600 m, depending on mean annual temperature, type of soil and rock, proximity to the ocean and topography. In the summer, only the soil surface may thaw, up to 20-60 cm. On slopes, the thawed soil may begin to move, a process called solifluction (Quinn 2008). Permafrost also creates specific landscape features collectively called patterned ground, forming circles, polygons, nets, hummocks, steps or stripes (Quinn 2008).'},\n",

Soils show cryogenic features. Alpine and tundra scree and talus, along with fell-fields and barrens are placed here because they contain cryomorphic vegetation similar to other vegetation in this class. Snowbank vegetation, which can be seasonally saturated, with wetland-like conditions, is tentatively included here.<br /><br />Placement of alpine vegetation in arctic and subarctic regions is under review. In those regions, the vegetation is beyond the latitudinal limits of trees. If alpine vegetation exists in those regions, then the subclass should include Arctic or Subarctic in the name.<br /><br />The High Arctic is often bare not because it is \"rock\" but because of the climate (cold and wind) and cryomorphic processes, hence it fits here. In true polar deserts, even cryptogams are sparse, and total cover is 0-3% (Quinn 2008).<br /><br />We include \"wet tundra\" (tundra on saturated, somewhat peaty soils) with dry to mesic tundra. Arctic wet meadows and marshes are treated with temperate and boreal wet meadows and marshes under <i>2.C.4 ~Temperate to Polar Freshwater Marsh, Wet Meadow & Shrubland Formation (F013)$$</i>.<br /><br />Alpine tundra of most Eurasian and North American mountains is similar to that of the Arctic tundra but with a richer flora (Quinn 2008).',\n",

Ionic composition of waters varies widely. The upper limits of salinity for Freshwater Aquatic Vegetation are set at 0.5 ppt, above which the vegetation is considered <i>5.A ~Saltwater Aquatic Vegetation Subclass (S09)$$</i>. Dissolved minerals, acid-base balances, and nutrient levels are influenced by the hydrology, underlying geological materials, nutrient fluxes, and plant communities. Freshwater Aquatic Vegetation is usually situated on substrates of limnic peat, mixed limnic organic-mineral material, and marl in stable-water regimes. Little sediment accumulation occurs in high-energy shallow waters such as tidal regimes, rivers or large lakes. In semi-arid regions, shallow waters dry up intermittently, often leaving evaporite alkaline salt deposits. Except in highly saline or acidic waters, these deposits provide a substrate for rooted submerged and floating macrophytes, algae and aquatic mosses (National Wetlands Working Group 1997).<br /><br />Freshwater Aquatic Vegetation is found in shallow water that usually has standing or flowing water <2 m deep in mid-summer. Water levels are seasonally stable, permanently flooded, or intermittently exposed during droughts or low flows. Shallow-water vegetation may also occupy bays and margins of profundal zones of lakes (National Wetlands Working Group 1997).<br /><br />Freshwater Aquatic Vegetation occurs in ponds, pools, shallow lakes, oxbows, sloughs, natural and artificial impoundments, or channels. Boundaries are determined by water-eroded shorelines, beaches or landward margins of mudflats, recent limnic deposits, floating mats, emergents or hydrophytic trees or shrubs. Bordering mats of rooted emergent vegetation, including inundated trees, may occupy up to 10% of the shallow-water area. Shallow waters are found in all hydrogeomorphic settings, but are usually associated with lacustrine, fluvial, stream, river, and permafrost systems (National Wetlands Working Group 1997).'},\n",

       "  'Overview': {'Classification Comments': 'The concept of this subclass extends to deeper water habitats (i.e., deeper than 2 m in lakes) and to riverine bottoms, but in practice, freshwater aquatic classifications may supersede this one from a user standpoint [see Formation Class]. That is, it may be desirable to first assign a lake or river type to the aquatic system, and secondarily note the NVC vegetation type present. Vegetation found in many urban and agricultural ponds may be very similar to natural freshwater aquatic vegetation, because agricultural and urban ponds typically manipulate the physical setting, not the vegetation itself. There are distinct cultural aquatic vegetation types, but these should be limited to situations in which the vegetation itself is manipulated for horticultural (e.g., aquatic gardens) or agricultural (e.g., water chestnuts grown in impoundments, rice paddies) that are parallel with terrestrial cultural vegetation. However, many agricultural ponds may actively prevent vegetation from forming. For practical applications of classification and mapping of freshwater aquatic vegetation, the agricultural and urban ponds may be initially placed within the <i>7. ~Agricultural & Developed Vegetation Cultural Class (CCL01)$$</i>, and, where evidence is gathered to show they have a natural composition, they may be reclassified.',\n",

Scree and other loose rocky substrates (volcanic cinders), where the median particle size is >10 cm in diameter, typically have enough soil development to support a dominant layer of disturbance-adapted, facultative mesomorphic shrubs and/or herbs (e.g., in the United States, <i>Ribes</i> spp., <i>Prunus virginiana</i>, and other forest, woodland, or shrubland shrubs in the central Rockies), and true lithomorphs (saxicolous lichens) are quite sparse, if present at all. Although the surface may be \"rocky,\" the driving ecological factor is the availability of soil in quantity under the relatively shallow rock armoring and the absence of large, stable substrates for true lithomorphs (saxicolous lichens) to establish. Cobbles along rivers and streams may also not typically support lithomorphic growth forms, and may best be treated as sometimes sparse flooded types within mesomorphic formations. Badlands (hard clays) and desert pavements also tend to support facultative vascular species, as opposed to lithomorphs or lithophiles, and could be considered for the xeromorphic class. Given this narrower definition of lithomorphic, a requirement for <10% vascular cover and nonvascular cover greater than vascular cover would be more appropriate for distinguishing the \"true\" lithomorphic types, and separate out sparse or occasionally sparse types (scree, volcanic cinders) in which vascular layers are clearly dominant and lithomorphic nonvascular is insignificant (C.

       "  'Environment': {'Environmental Description': '<i>Climate</i>: Tropical Dry Forest & Woodland occurs in areas where the air subsides near the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) migrates north and south seasonally, producing the alternating pattern of rainfall and dryness. The average drought season varies in length from 3 to 6 months and is generally coincident with the annual lowest temperatures. Annual rainfall ranges from 100 to 200 cm (Whitmore 1998), or where the annual rainfall is <160 cm, with a period of at least 5 to 6 months receiving <10 cm, during which some or all of the trees lose their leaves (Pennington et al. 2006). The climate is warm tropical pluviseasonal, subhumid to humid.<br /><br /><i>Soil/substrate/hydrology</i>: The substrate often includes large areas of highly weathered reddish soils with high iron and aluminum content and low mineral nutrients content, as well as frequent development of laterization. The main soil orders in the U.S. system associated with Tropical Dry Forest & Woodland are Oxisols, Ultisols and Alfisols (Soil Survey Staff 1999) [see Brady and Weil (2002) for comparison of U.S. soil orders with Canadian and FAO systems]. More rarely, they occur on mesotrophic soils. This type also occurs on limestone substrates in the Caribbean and Mesoamerica (Lugo et al. 2006).<br /><br />In most areas, Tropical Dry Forest & Woodland supports seasonal regimes of fire, both natural and characteristically human induced, which can cause frequent pyrogenic secondary savannized or woodland physiognomies. Fires, in conjunction with climate, are likely to partially explain the distribution of Tropical Dry Forest & Woodland (Bond et al. 2005).<br /><br />Tropical Dry Forest & Woodland tends to occur at lower elevations. However, in South America, large more-or-less isolated pockets occur in several valleys of the eastern slopes of the Andes, particularly in southern Peru and Bolivia, where they can reach altitudes up to approximately 1200 m.'},\n",

       "  'Overview': {'Classification Comments': 'Mooney et al. (1995) suggest that Tropical Dry Forest & Woodland may be defined as forest occurring in tropical regions characterized by pronounced seasonality in rainfall distribution, resulting in several months of drought. The forests that develop under such climatic conditions share a broadly similar structure and physiognomy; they mainly occur on oligotrophic, reddish soils (Oxisols, Ultisols), but may also occur on mesotrophic soils. Beyond that, they note that these shared characteristics are difficult to define with precision. They may either be deciduous or evergreen, though typically small-leaved, and either open- or closed-canopy. There are sclerophyllous evergreen broad-leaved (mesophyllous- to macrophyllous-leaved) Tropical Dry Forest & Woodland in the Brazilian-Bolivian Cerrado. But we include here only the most closed form of cerrado (i.e., the cerradão) and the more typical cerrado is placed in <i>2.A. ~Tropical Grassland, Savanna & Shrubland Subclass (S01)$$</i>.<br /><br />Many authors include thorn woodlands as part of a broadly defined \"tropical dry forest\" or \"seasonally dry tropical forest\" (SDTF). For example, Pennington et al. (2006) use a wide interpretation of SDTF in the Neotropics, including formations as diverse as tall forest on moister sites to cactus scrub on the driest, but they exclude the Chaco of Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia because it receives frost. See also Oliveira-Filho et al. (2006) who include caatingas and carrascos within their broad definition of SDTF, but exclude cerrados and chaco. Here we treat <i>3.A.1 ~Tropical Thorn Woodland Formation (F039)$$</i> as a separate xeromorphic growth form-based formation that includes, in the Neotropics, caatingas, carrascos, and chaco.<br /><br />Tropical monsoon forests are sometimes grouped with <i>1.A.2 ~Tropical Lowland Humid Forest Formation (F020)$$</i> as \"tropical moist forest,\" but being deciduous with pronounced drought periods, they are better included here with <i>1.A.1 ~Tropical Dry Forest & Woodland Formation (F003)$$</i> (Whitmore 1998). Further review of the range of variation in tropical monsoon forests is needed, to clarify the transition to Tropical Lowland Humid Forest.',\n",

       "   'Diagnostic Characteristics': 'Tropical Dry Forest & Woodland is dominated by broad-leaved drought-deciduous trees or, more rarely, small-leaved (micro- to mesophyll) evergreen trees or broad-leaved (meso- to macrophyll) sclerophyllous-leaved trees. Thorn forest scrub, and scrubby cerrado are excluded. Evergreen needle-leaved trees may occur in association with these other growth forms. Climates are consistently warm (seasonal daily temperatures with minimal variation), and annual rainfall is strongly seasonal, but average annual rainfall is typically >100 cm.',\n",

       "   'Type Concept': 'Tropical Dry Forest & Woodland, including most monsoon forests, occurs in extensive areas near the equator around the globe between about 10° and 23°N and S latitude, though it is also found near windward coasts and on the leeward sides of mountains or islands. These forests are dominated by broad-leaved drought-deciduous trees or small-leaved (micro- to mesophyll) evergreen trees or broad-leaved (meso- to macrophyll) sclerophyllous-leaved trees. Evergreen needle-leaved trees may occur in association with these other growth forms. It is a medium to high forest varying on average from 15 to 25 m tall, typically with several structural levels as complex upper canopy, several subcanopy levels of treelets and shrubs, woody vines, and an irregular low herbaceous plant stratum. Canopy heights decrease and canopy coverage tends to decrease as the climate dries until the forests are reduced to open, short-statured (5-15 m) woodlands (more rarely shorter). Included are semi-evergreen, partially sclerophyllous, semi-deciduous and deciduous, mostly dense to semi-dense forests adapted for a distinct period of seasonal winter drought, resulting in 4 to 7 months of drought (rainfall 60 mm or less), during which some or all of the trees lose their leaves. Annual rainfall ranges from 100 to 200 cm. The considerable diversity of dry tropical forest and woodland types are related to the topographic, hydric and edaphic variations as well as with the floristic composition and different biogeography.',\n",
       "   'Type Concept Sentence': 'Tropical Dry Forest & Woodland is dominated by broad-leaved drought-deciduous, semi-deciduous, and small-leaved or sclerophyllous evergreen trees where rainfall is lower, often associated with more strongly seasonal, tropical climates, rainshadows, or drying winds.

       "  'Vegetation': {'Physiognomy and Structure': 'Tropical Dry Forest & Woodland is dominated by broad-leaved drought-deciduous trees or, more rarely, small-leaved (micro- to mesophyll) evergreen trees or broad-leaved (meso- to macrophyll) sclerophyllous-leaved trees (Lugo et al. 2006). Evergreen needle-leaved trees may occur in association with these other growth forms. It is a medium to high forest varying on average from 15 to 25 m tall, typically with several structural levels as complex upper canopy, several subcanopy levels of treelets and shrubs, woody vines, and an irregular low herbaceous plant stratum. Canopy heights decrease and canopy coverage tends to decrease as the climate dries until the forests are reduced to open, short-statured (5-15 m) woodlands (more rarely shorter). Included are semi-evergreen, partially sclerophyllous, semi-deciduous and deciduous, mostly dense to semi-dense forest (Whittaker 1975).<br /><br />In the Neotropics the lower forest level is often dominated by colonies of clumping terrestrial bromeliads. Overall, there is a predominance in the canopy of medium-sized leaves (mesophyllous) that fall partially or almost completely in the dry season. Tall arborescent cacti can be frequent in dry semi-deciduous forest of the Neotropics and physiognomically similar arborescent succulent euphorbias in the Paleotropics. In western Brazil, eastern Bolivia, and Paraguay, this formation includes large stands of medium-low and partially sclerophyllous semi-evergreen forests or \"cerradão,\" with characteristic adaptations to drought and fire, such as very corky bark on twisted trunks and xylopodiums (but we exclude the more typical cerrado, which is placed with <i>2.A. ~Tropical Grassland, Savanna & Shrubland Subclass (S01)$$</i>).'},\n",

In general, a tropical rainforest climate can be defined as one with monthly mean temperatures of at least 18°C throughout the year, and an annual rainfall of at least 170 cm (and usually above 200 cm) and either no dry season or a short one of fewer than 4 consecutive months with <10 cm rainfall (Richards 1996, Whitmore 1998).<br /><br />African rainforests are primarily semi-evergreen (where deciduous trees may comprise up to 25% of the main canopy), as are Australian rainforests, and various parts of other regional rainforest blocks (Whitmore 1998).<br /><br /><i>Soil/substrate/hydrology</i>: These forests generally occur from sea level to approximately 1200 m elevation, but the boundary between lowland and montane forests occurs at different elevations depending on the \"Massenerhebung effect\" (Collins 1990, Richards 1996). This is a phenomenon whereby large mountains and the central parts of large ranges are warmer at given elevations than small mountains and outlying spurs. Thus Collins (1990) mapped the boundaries in the Caribbean, Central America, Madagascar, Australia and Southeast Asia at 910 m, whereas in West Africa the boundary was set at 1200 m, in New Guinea at 1400 m and in South America at 1800 m.<br /><br />Soils are often ancient and deeply weathered, with little organic darkening of the topsoil and with bright reddish or yellowish colors throughout the subsoil. Few of the original rock minerals remain in the upper horizon. Organic content may vary. Soils are often clay-like, but weathered sands also occur. Other more recent soils include those found on recent volcanic deposits, colluvial and alluvial soils (Richards 1996).'},\n",

They occur on podsolized soils developed from siliceous sand, either coastal alluvium or weathered sandstones. Although typically found in a rainforest climate and retaining basic growth forms characteristic of <i>1.A.2 ~Tropical Lowland Humid Forest Formation (F020)$$</i>, the nutrient-poor, acidic conditions produce a strikingly distinct physiognomy. Here are found dense, often pole-sized trees, a stronger predominance of microphylls over mesophylls, with some sclerophylly, and woody climbers that are more often slender. The most extensive heath forests are found in the upper reaches of the Rio Negro and Rio Orinoco of South America, also in Guyana (wallaba forests of <i>Eperua falcata</i>), coastal forests of southeastern Madagascar, Gabon, Cameroon and Ivory Coast, and in Kalimantan, Sarawak and Brunei in Borneo (referred to as kerangas), and parts of Malaya (Whitmore 1998).<br /><br />Tropical montane forests may resemble heath forests to some degree (Whitmore 1998).<br /><br />Tropical monsoon forests are sometimes grouped with Tropical Lowland Humid Forest as \"tropical moist forest\" (Whitmore 1998), but by and large, they are included with <i>1.A.1 ~Tropical Dry Forest & Woodland Formation (F003)$$</i>.

       "   'Type Concept': 'Tropical Lowland Humid Forest occurs in the humid tropics, often within 10°of the equator, where rainfall is abundant and well-distributed throughout most or much of the year, including both wet evergreen and moist semi-evergreen forest. Elevations range from lowland to submontane or premontane, with ranges from sea level to between 1000 and 1700 m depending on location. Soils are often ancient and deeply weathered, reddish and yellow clays or sands, or more recent soils found on volcanic, colluvial and alluvial deposits. Tree growth forms predominate and are tall, of numerous species, with buttressed bases (in some cases), often smooth bark, and evergreen meso- to macrophyll leaves. Also present may be tree ferns, large woody climbers or lianas, and both vascular and nonvascular epiphytes, often of greater diversity than the ground layer. Heights often exceed 30 m. Evergreenness varies from completely evergreen to semi-evergreen seasonal forests, in which around 25% of the main canopy may be regularly deciduous. The vegetation is often species-rich, often lacking dominants, with the majority of the tree species of very low abundance.',\n",

       "  'Environment': {'Environmental Description': '<i>Soil/substrate/hydrology</i>: Tropical swamp forests can be divided into freshwater or brackish swamp or floodplain forest (along rivers and lakes) and peat swamp forest (formed behind natural floodplain levees), where peat layers may be well in excess of 1 m thick (Whitmore 1984). The floodplain forests are found along rivers, streams, coasts, and lakes. They have a dynamic water table, with seasonal flooding inundating the vegetation for short (<7 days) to long (>1 month) periods, leading to an influx of sediment and mineral enrichment during high water periods. Information about underlying soils is scarce.<br /><br />Many floodplain swamp forests are potentially peat-accumulating, but, although studies on this subject exist in Southeast Asia, they have apparently never been published for the Amazon basin (Whitmore 1998). Swamps and other types of wetlands in the Neotropics have been described in terms of their vegetation composition, structure, and geomorphology, but studies have failed to deal with peat formation or detailed descriptions of the underlying soils. There is evidence that at least the <i>Mauritia</i> swamps frequently accumulate peat of some kind.<br /><br />The lowland tropical peat swamps are formed from layers of woody debris too waterlogged to fully decompose. Slowly deposited over thousands of years, the carbon-rich peat strata have been known to reach a thickness of up to 20 m. In Indonesia the ombrogenous peatlands are mostly formed on the inward edge of the mangroves. They are usually dome-shaped and several meters thick overlying the mangrove mineral soil; the whole sequence taking several thousand years. Periods with rising sea levels promote the formation of very deep peat layers up to 20 m thickness with the alluvial soil far below present sea levels. Peat domes younger than 3000 years do have the alluvial soil at about present mean sea level.<br /><br />The initial rate of vegetation growth and peat build-up is rapid, as the alluvial mangrove soils are nutrient-rich. As the peat accumulates, it builds up above the level of the nutrients in the alluvial soils that are accessible for the plant roots. In that case, the mineral supply to the vegetation depends on the minerals in the rainwater and available nutrients of the decaying vegetation in the surface layer. As the swamp ages and the peat layer increases, nutrients become increasingly scarce, tree growth and litter production are reduced, and growth of the whole formation slows down.<br /><br />Besides its association with mangroves, the lowland Neotropical peatlands are associated with palm swamps and open herbaceous marshes. The latter apparently are relatively nutrient-rich, since surface runoff water easily reaches all parts of the swamps. Furthermore, the layer of organic material is usually thin enough for the roots of the plants to have direct contact with the underlying mineral soil. In the case of palm swamps, they may be regularly affected by riverine floods, but for most of their extent they occur farther from current river channels, the water-logged condition then being maintained by a combination of high precipitation and poor drainage, which makes them ombrogenous types of peatlands.'},\n",

       "   'Type Concept': 'Tropical Flooded & Swamp Forest is a forested or wooded wetland and peatland. Structural characteristics that recur in flooded forests are presence of monospecific stands such as palm swamp, even-canopied forests, and sharp vegetation zonation. Trees in flooded tropical forests may develop sclerophylly (firm, thickened leaves) due to poor nutrition or water limitations, gas exchange structures (e.g., pneumatophores, lenticels, knees, aerial roots, swelling of base of trees, surface or aerial roots) in order to overcome poor soil aeration, or support structures (e.g., plank buttresses and stilt roots) to provide stability in muddy or steep conditions. Tree heights can vary greatly, from 1 to 50 m. Tropical swamp forests can be divided into freshwater swamp or floodplain forest (along rivers and lakes) and peat swamp forest (formed behind natural floodplain levees), where peat layers may be well in excess of 1 m thick. The floodplain forests are found along rivers, streams and lakes. They have a dynamic water table, with seasonal flooding inundating the vegetation for short (<7 days) to long (>1 month) periods, leading to an influx of sediment and mineral enrichment during high water periods.<br /><br />Floristic composition, diversity and structure of these forests can vary considerably depending on the characteristics of the flood. For example, in the Neotropics, turbid white-water flooded forests may be distinguished from limpid black- and clear-water flooded forests based on the significant amount of suspended sediment and dissolved calcium in white water, as compared to the low sediment load and low concentration of calcium in black and clear waters. Also, the black waters typically contain significant amounts of humic acid substances in colloidal suspension. Another important cause of ecological variation in these forests is related to the type of flooding, mainly flooded regime (inundation by waters flowing from the overflow of rivers and relatively fast drainage) versus stagnant waters that accumulate in large shallow topographic depressions and that are only slowly removed by evaporation (ponded regime).',\n",

These palm swamps may be regularly affected by riverine floods, but they mostly occur farther from current river channels, the water-logged condition then being maintained by a combination of high precipitation and poor drainage in depressional terrain. Other palm-associated (<i>Raphia, Manicaria</i>) swamps are typical of the coastal regions of Central America and northern South America along estuarine channels, sometimes in mixed stands with a few mangrove species.'},\n",

       "  'Environment': {'Environmental Description': '<i>Soil/substrate/hydrology</i>: Mangroves (mangal, mangle) are tidal, estuarine forested wetlands that occur along the (sheltered) coasts of tropical latitudes of the Earth. They are commonly found on the intertidal mudflats along the shores of estuaries, usually in the region between the salt marshes and sea-grass beds. Where tidal amplitude is relatively low, they form narrow bands along the coastal plains, and rarely penetrate inland more than several kilometers along rivers. Where tidal amplitude is greater, mangroves extend farther inland along river courses forming extensive stands in the major river deltas. Mangrove cays occur also within the lagoon complex of barrier reefs (Stoddart et al. 1982). In general, mangroves fall within two categories: mangroves of oceanic islands and inland mangroves. The latter need to adapt to a pronounced variation in salinity due to the variations in freshwater carried from the interior streams, while the former owe the salinity gradient to the rate of evaporation in the shallow ponds and mudflats and the rainfall on site, especially in the case of small to very small islands.<br /><br />Gilmore and Snedaker (1993) described five distinct types of mangrove forests based on water level, wave energy, and pore water salinity: (1) mangrove fringe forests, (2) overwash mangrove islands, (3) riverine mangrove forests, (4) basin mangrove forests, and (5) dwarf mangrove forests. Dwarf forests are most commonly observed in south Florida, around the vicinity of the Everglades, but occur in all portions of the range where physical conditions are suboptimal, especially in drier transitional areas.<br /><br />Rainfall plays an important role in distribution and species composition because rainfall regulates salt concentrations in soils and plants, as well as providing a source of freshwater for the mangroves. This is an important factor when propagules begin to take root and when mature individuals bloom and fruit. If high rainfall occurs over a short period and other months of the year are prone to drought, the conditions can be considered unfavorable for the growth and distribution of mangroves.<br /><br />Mangroves provide habitats for commercially important crustaceans; are important nursery grounds for juvenile fish; filter and trap pollutants and sediments from land runoff thus maintaining estuarine water quality; provide barriers and buffer zones to stabilize shorelines and prevent coastal erosion; and are also a major producer of organic material. Mangroves protect the coast against erosion, but monsoons and storms cause large waves and winds to erode the coast, destroying many mangrove areas. Sea level rise, together with monsoons or hurricanes and storms, accelerates the speed of mangrove coastal erosion.<br /><br />Mangroves cannot tolerate frost, especially in the seedling stage, but mangroves are also regulated by sea temperatures, rarely occurring outside the range delimited by the winter position of the 20°C isotherm (Hogarth 2007). It is not entirely clear why mangroves are limited to the tropics. Given their pan-tropical distribution and the wide availability of muddy, saline habitats in temperate regions, there would seem to be many suitable opportunities to spread into these latitudes. Hogarth (2007) suggests that perhaps the combination of being a tree, tolerating salt, and coping with waterlogging creates a metabolic cost that is difficult to sustain in lower temperatures and shorter day lengths.'},\n",

Cool-temperate and warm-temperate forests may be difficult to distinguish, but cool-temperate forests are more strongly dominated by broad-leaved deciduous trees, and broad-leaved evergreen trees are essentially absent. Braun (1950) includes at least parts of these warm-temperate forests in her \"Deciduous Forest Formation\" (the \"Southeastern Evergreen Forest Region\"), but briefly notes a \"Subtropical Broad-leaved Evergreen Forest\" that includes central Florida southward.<br /><br />Various ecoregional treatments recognize the distinct vegetation and climate of the warm-temperate region, e.g., Brown et al. (1998) separates cool-temperate from warm-temperate vegetation. Walter (1985) recognizes two warm-temperate biomes, the \"Zonobiome of the Winter-Rain Region with an Arid-Humid Climate and Sclerophyllic Woodlands\" (Zone IV) and the \"Zonobiome of the Warm-Temperate Humid Climate\" (Zone V), distinct from the cool-temperate biome \"Zonobiome of the Temperate-Nemoral Climate\" (Zone VI) and the boreal biome \"Zonobiome of the Cold-Temperate Boreal Climate\" (Zone VIII). Similarly, Schultz (1995) recognizes the two warm-temperate regions, which he refers to as: \"Mediterranean-Type subtropics\" (with world distribution shown in his Figure 129) and \"Humid subtropics\" (with world distribution shown in his Figure 171). We prefer the term warm-temperate to subtropics. Schultz states that \"apart from the driest sites and those with lowest nutrient contents, all the regions of the Mediterranean-Type subtropics were originally covered by forests of mostly evergreen sclerophyllous species of trees\" and in the European Mediterranean region, these were mostly evergreen oak, such as <i>Quercus ilex</i>. Today, many of these regions are more typically dominated by sclerophyllous shrub formations, as described in 2.B.1 ~Mediterranean Scrub & Grassland Formation (F038)$$.',\n",

Cool-temperate forests may occur as minor components of southern and montane New Zealand and in Australia, especially Tasmania. Cool-temperate forests also occur in Chile.<br /><br />Inclusion of western North American conifer forests and woodlands in this temperate formation (rather a broadly defined boreal and temperate conifer forest) follows that of Brandt (2009). However, some authors expand the boreal formation to include the subalpine or high montane forests within the temperate zone (e.g., Whittaker (1975) - the \"subarctic-subalpine needle-leaved forests\"; Brown et al. (1998) - Boreal and Subalpine Forest &amp; Woodland). Within North America, this creates challenges for placement of <i>Picea rubens</i> (red spruce) forests in the northern temperate region, which are partly subalpine or high montane, but are most common at lower elevations. We follow a more floristic, biogeographic and ecological approach in treating the subalpine forests with their lower elevation counterparts at the formation level. But we recognize that high montane and subalpine forests are also similar to boreal forests in regard to some aspects of climate, species diversity patterns, and floristic similarity (at least at the genus level). Warm-temperate and cool-temperate forest &amp; woodland formations are very similar, but differences are driven by increasing presence of broad-leaved evergreen trees and shrubs, and evergreen herb layer that corresponds with broad climatic patterns. Overlap with boreal forests in the western montane region also presents conceptual challenges.',\n",

The 50 to 150 cm (20-60 inches) of precipitation are distributed evenly throughout the year.

Some soils (Alfisols) have relatively high natural fertility; others are more leached, due to higher precipitation levels (Ultisols) and more common in the warmer parts of the region.

       "  'Overview': {'Classification Comments': 'This formation includes a range of conifer and broad-leaved hardwood growth forms. The formation is sometimes restricted to \"temperate broadleaf forest regions,\" but even there, pure conifer stands can occur, e.g., in temperate eastern North America, there are pure conifer stands of <i>Tsuga canadensis</i> and <i>Pinus strobus</i>. Inclusion of western North American conifer forests in this cool-temperate formation rather than the Boreal Forest & Woodland follows that of Brandt (2009) and others. Warm-temperate and cool-temperate forest and woodland formations are very similar, but differences are driven by broad climatic patterns. Overlap with boreal forests in the western montane region also presents conceptual challenges.<br /><br />Various ecoregional treatments recognize the distinct vegetation and climate of the cool-temperate region, e.g., Brown et al. (1998) separate cool-temperate from warm-temperate vegetation. Walter (1985) recognizes the cool-temperate biome \"Zonobiome of the Temperate-Nemoral Climate\" (Zone VI) distinct from two warm-temperate biomes, the \"Zonobiome of the Winter-Rain Region with an Arid-Humid Climate and Sclerophyllic Woodlands\" (Zone IV) and the \"Zonobiome of the Warm-Temperate Humid Climate\" (Zone V), and from the boreal biome \"Zonobiome of the Cold-temperate Boreal Climate\" (Zone VIII).<br /><br />Our approach treats the subalpine forests of the Rocky Mountain region as part of <i>1.B.2 ~Cool Temperate Forest & Woodland Formation (F008)$$</i>, rather than as part of <i>1.B.4 ~Boreal Forest & Woodland Formation (F001)$$</i>, such as done by Whittaker (1975) and Brown et al. (1998). Our decision is in line with a more biogeographic approach for divisions, and corresponds to that of Rivas-Martinez et al. (1999b), but is debatable from a structural and climatic perspective. As Chris Lea (pers. comm. 2012) notes, one could retain lowland and lower montane western coniferous forests in Cool Temperate, but move high montane and subalpine to the Boreal formation, to which they also have strong floristic and environmental similarities (this would require a name change of the latter to something like \"Boreal & High Montane\" or \"Boreal & Subalpine\" formation). This would have minimal impact on lower level units, requiring only a transfer of two current western North America groups (G020 and G025) to F001, under a new (western North American) division of F001 and eastern North America group G024 (requires a new macrogroup and division, but the description of these would be identical with the existing group description). The only major new description for Forests and Woodlands would be a new division description for \"Western North America High Montane & Subalpine Forest,\" within formation F001. These forests, fairly simply, contain quaking aspen and lodgepole pine on up through the Engelmann spruce-fir types. In the Sierra Nevada, Ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, \"mixed conifers\" (white fir, etc.) represent the upper limits of <i>1.B.3 ~Temperate Flooded & Swamp Forest Formation (F026)$$</i>. The Shrubland & Grassland class needs no formation-level adjustments, but some lower level adjustments might be needed for consistency. We will continue to review this issue as we compare our work with that of Eurasian treatments of boreal and cool-temperate (nemoral) forests.',\n",

Rainforest trees may attain great heights; trees easily exceed 50 m, but these forests more typically range from 10 to 30 m in height. They are found in oceanic temperate to cool-temperate continental climates, with summer rainfall and cold winters (during which the broad-leaved trees lose their leaves), extending to treeline, where they resemble boreal forests.<br /><br />The formation is most prominent in the Northern Hemisphere, where it occurs in four major, formation expressions in (1) western and central Europe, (2) eastern Asia, including Korea and Japan, (3) eastern North America, and (4) western North America. It occurs as small formation expressions in the Southern Hemisphere, including southern South America (Chile and Argentina), southern Australia, and New Zealand. This formation is associated with cooler continental and oceanic temperate climates (Koeppen Dca, Dcb, and Do, and in Europe, Cfb). There is an approximately 6-month growing season. The 50 to 150 cm (20-60 inches) of precipitation is distributed evenly throughout the year. The non-growing season is due to temperature-induced drought during the cold winters.<br /><br />Forest structure is usually complex in moist climates and habitats, commonly consisting of five strata: (1) a tree stratum, 15-35 m (60-100 feet) tall, dominated by broad-leaved deciduous and/or needle-leaved evergreen species, often with a substratum of small trees (5-15 m tall); (2) a small-tree and tall-sapling layer (between 2-5 m); (3) a short-shrub layer (<2 m); (4) an herb layer of perennial forbs, including an ecological group with species that bloom primarily in early spring (in deciduous broadleaf-dominated examples); and (5) a ground layer of lichens, clubmosses, and true mosses. Lichens and mosses also grow on the trunks of trees. In dry and fire-dependent climates and regions, the structure may be simple, with a tree layer (>10%) and a strong grassy or shrubby ground layer. Natural disturbances include wind and fire.',\n",

In dry and fire-dependent climates and regions, the structure may be simple, with a tree layer (>10%) and a strong grassy or shrubby ground layer. In western North America, structure is more variable, reflecting the range of ecological sites, from high mountains and valleys, to coastal rainforests with a variety of mesoclimates. Structural variability ranges from short-statured conifers, with a sparse understory and heavy duff layer, to the tallest and largest trees in the world in moist to wet climates, with shrub, herb and moss growth forms prominent (Whittaker 1975).<br /><br />Many of the genera, previously part of an Arcto-Tertiary Geoflora, are common to all three of the disjunct Northern Hemisphere broadleaf expressions of this biome.

Different species of these genera occur on each continent. In the Southern Hemisphere different sets of genera and species are found. Western North America contains a much reduced set of hardwood genera and expanded conifer diversity (<i>Abies, Picea, Pinus, Pseudotsuga, Thuja, Tsuga</i>). Transitions to the boreal forests are also apparent.<br /><br />The temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere differ from their northern counterparts. Distinctions between warm-temperate and cool-temperate are much contracted (e.g., in parts of the evergreen southern beech <i>Nothofagus</i> forests in South America, Australia and New Zealand).'},\n",

       "  'Environment': {'Environmental Description': '<i>Soil/substrate/hydrology:</i> In swamp forests, the water table is often below the major portion of the ground surface, and the dominant ground surface is at the hummock ground surface, that is, 20 cm or more above the average summer groundwater level. It is the aerated (or partly aerated) zone of substrates above the water that is available for root growth of trees. These temperate swamps are not as wet as marshes, fens and the open bogs. The drier treed swamps grade into upland forest on mineral soil, and the wettest treed swamps grade into scrubby treed fen, which is wetter with less tree canopy cover. Scrubby tree fens may grade into tall-shrub swamps, but they are somewhat drier and have at least 10% tree canopy cover (National Wetlands Working Group 1997).<br /><br />Flooded forests (sometimes called riverine or riparian swamps) have a more dynamic water table, with seasonal flooding inundating the vegetation for short (<7 days) to long (>1 month) periods. They are found along rivers, streams, and lakes. They are subject to dramatic water fluctuations, seasonal flooding, and an influx of sediment and mineral enrichment during high water periods. Peat accumulation is usually shallow, often <40 cm, but depths of 1 m can exist (National Wetlands Working Group 1997).<br /><br />The temperate flooded and swamp forest occurs on mineral soils as well as on peat. In the cool-temperate regions, the texture of underlying mineral soils is variable, ranging from clays to sands, and they frequently are Gleysols. On sands, iron-rich ortsteins or fragipans are often present, acting as impermeable layers that impede water drainage. Swamps on mineral soils tend to accumulate peat by paludification. When organic soils develop, they are Histosols (U.S. system) or Mesisols or Humisols (Canadian system) that are rich in woody peat, at least in the surface layers [see Brady and Weil (2002) for a comparison of U.S. soil orders with Canadian and FAO systems]. Swamps on peat have developed either by a basin-filling process or by paludification of previously drier mineral soils. In the basin-filling process, the previous ecosystem was a marsh or fen, whereas in paludification the swamp has developed over an older, dry upland forest on mineral soil (National Wetlands Working Group 1997).<br /><br />The nutrient regime in swamps is highly variable, ranging from base-rich conditions with pH above 7.0, to base-poor conditions where pH can be in the range of 4.5 or lower. Temperate swamp forms may be recognized based on the base-rich/pH gradient, i.e., calcareous rich (eutrophic), intermediate (mesotrophic), and poor (oligotrophic) (National Wetlands Working Group 1997).'},\n",

       "  'Environment': {'Environmental Description': 'According to Brandt (2009), the boreal zone\\'s northern boundary in both North America and Eurasia is generally the southern limit of the tundra; its southern boundary generally coincides with the northern limit of temperate forests, or grasslands (steppes).<br /><br /><i>Climate:</i> There are lengthy periods of freezing temperatures with the coldest month isotherm of -3°C, and the growing season generally averaging less than 100 days, occasionally interrupted by nights of below-freezing temperatures. Snow may be present for extended periods (7-10 months) and soils are typically frozen in winter. Annual precipitation is 38-50 cm (15-20 inches). In North America, the northern boundary of the forest corresponds to the July isotherm of 13°C, with departures due to montane or maritime influences (Elliott-Fisk 2000). The southern boundary in central and eastern Canada corresponds approximately with the 18°C July isotherm, but in the west the forest border shifts to slightly cooler regions with higher precipitation (Elliott-Fisk 2000). These broad-scale climatic factors are modified by local and regional topography, climates and soils.<br /><br />Brandt (2009, and Table 2 therein) characterizes the limits of boreal forests based on their dominance by \"cold-tolerant\" trees species, i.e., tolerant of temperatures of -80°C or lower (primarily within <i>Abies, Larix, Picea</i>, or <i>Pinus</i> but also <i>Populus</i> and <i>Betula</i>). Temperate forests are characterized by \"cold-intolerant\" species, i.e., they require temperatures above -45°C to survive. A number of temperate species have \"intermediate cold-tolerance,\" common to the cool-temperate forest. Regions of the landscape where both species co-occur is sometimes referred to as the \"hemiboreal subzone,\" that is, the northern parts of the cool-temperate zone where cold-intolerant tree species, cold-tolerant tree species, and species with intermediate cold-tolerance co-occur, and with the cold-tolerant species contributing substantially to the forest cover. Brandt\\'s information provides the cold-tolerance limits of these species, but equally valuable in understanding the temperate versus boreal distinction would be the warm-tolerance limits. For example, in North America, <i>Picea mariana</i> appears to be less warm-tolerant than <i>Pinus banksiana</i>, but both have the same cold tolerance.<br /><br /><i>Soil/substrate/hydrology:</i> Most boreal soils were subject to extensive glaciations (excluding parts of the Yukon Territory, the Northwest Territories, and Alaska). Soils are somewhat poorly to excessively drained. They are the result of podzolization, which is a consequence of low temperatures and excess precipitation above that of evapotranspiration. Soils often contain a sandy ash-colored A horizon, with an accumulation of iron and aluminum with organic matter in the B horizon. Soils are generally of low fertility, as nutrients are also removed from the upper horizons. With the low temperatures, organic matter decomposes slowly, resulting in acidic soil conditions and low nitrogen and mineral levels (Elliott-Fisk 2000, Kuennecke 2008). Permafrost is absent or typically occurs <100 cm below the surface in the Boreal Forest & Woodland zone. Spodosols are most common; Inceptisols, Histosols, and Entisols occasional (Soil Survey Staff 1999) [see Brady and Weil (2002) for a comparison of U.S. soil orders with Canadian and FAO systems].'},\n",

       "  'Overview': {'Classification Comments': 'The Braun-Blanquet approach generally recognizes the <i>Vaccinio-Piceetea</i> class of vegetation as synonymous with Eurasian and North American boreal and sub-boreal coniferous forests, including both upland boreal forests and forested swamps (Peinado et al. 1998, Spribille and Chytrý 2002, Kolbek et al. 2003); however, Rivas-Martinez et al. (1999b) separated the North American Boreal Forest & Woodland into a separate class, distinct from both European boreal forests and western temperate forests.<br /><br />Various ecoregional treatments recognize the distinct vegetation and climate of the boreal region, compared to the temperate region. Brown et al. (1998) separates arctic-boreal from both cool-temperate and warm-temperate vegetation. Walter (1985) recognizes the boreal biome \"Zonobiome of the Cold-temperate Boreal Climate\" (Zone VIII), distinct from the cool-temperate biome \"Zonobiome of the Temperate-Nemoral Climate\" (Zone VI) and two warm-temperate biomes, the \"Zonobiome of the Winter-Rain Region with an Arid-Humid Climate and Sclerophyllic Woodlands\" (Zone IV) and the \"Zonobiome of the Warm-Temperate Humid Climate\" (Zone V).<br /><br />Some authors extend the North American Boreal Forest & Woodland southward into the southern Rocky Mountains and/or Appalachian Mountains (e.g., Whittaker 1975, Brown et al. 1998, Kuennecke 2008), primarily because of the spruce-fir zones that occur in those ranges. But the more temperate climate, increasingly diverse conifer and hardwood growth forms, biogeographic patterns and distinctive species suggest that they can satisfactorily be placed in a temperate formation, where they extend up to the treeline in the subalpine regions [see also Rivas-Martinez et al. (1999b)]. However, biogeographic comparisons across larger regions, including biome or formation scales, and which can be done at the genus level and above (e.g., McLaughlin 2007), suggest a greater similarity of high-elevation Engelmann spruce-fir in the Rocky Mountains with that of the boreal. But similarities are less strong in the eastern deciduous region, where red spruce-fir forests share more species with the eastern temperate region. Chris Lea (pers. comm. 2012) notes that there are a number of subdominant species common to North American high montane/subalpine forests, North American boreal forests, and Eurasian boreal forests (a number of <i>Vaccinium</i> spp., <i>Linnaea borealis, Carex aquatilis, Carex utriculata</i>, etc.), and at least one dominant tree species (<i>Populus tremuloides</i>) that is common to North American high montane/subalpine and North American boreal forests. Additionally, many fauna species (lynx, pine marten, pine grosbeak, golden-crowned kinglet, crossbills, etc.) show similar species distribution patterns. But many of these species also have considerable overlap in the temperate zone. We will continue to review this issue with North American and Eurasian colleagues.',\n",

It is bounded on the north by tundra and on the south by either the northern limit of temperate lowland and subalpine forests or grasslands (steppes).

It is dominated by needle-leaved (usually evergreen, conical-shaped) conifers, and broad-leaved deciduous hardwoods. Lichens and mosses often dominate the ground layer. The structure of Boreal Forest & Woodland varies from closed forest to lichen woodland and forest-tundra.

       "  'Environment': {'Environmental Description': '<i>Soil/substrate/hydrology:</i> The water table is below most of the ground surface, and the dominant ground surface is at the hummock, that is, 20 cm or more above the average summer groundwater level. It is the aerated (or partly aerated) zone of substrates above the water that is available for root growth of trees and/or tall shrubs. Boreal swamps are not as wet as marshes, fens, and the open bogs. The drier treed swamps grade into upland forest on mineral soil, and the wettest treed swamps include tree fen, which is wetter with less tree canopy cover. Tree bogs can form on raised bogs, where the sphagnum mat may be relatively dry (National Wetlands Working Group 1997).<br /><br />Boreal Flooded & Swamp Forest occurs on mineral soils as well as on peat. In the boreal region, the texture of underlying mineral soils is variable, ranging from clays to sands, and they frequently are Gleysols. On sands, iron-rich ortsteins or fragipans are often present, acting as impermeable layers that impede water drainage. Swamps on mineral soils tend to accumulate peat by the paludification process. When organic soils develop, they are Histosols (U.S. system) or Mesisols or Humisols (Canadian system) that are rich in woody peat, at least in the surface layers [see Brady and Weil 2002 for comparison of U.S. soil orders with Canadian and FAO systems]. Swamps on peat have developed by a basin-filling process or by paludification of previously drier mineral soils. In the basin-filling process, the previous ecosystem was a marsh or open fen, whereas in paludification, the swamp has developed over an older, dry upland forest on mineral soil (National Wetlands Working Group 1997).<br /><br />The nutrient regime in swamps is highly variable, ranging from base-rich conditions with pH above 7.0, to base-poor conditions where pH can be in the range of 4.5 or lower. Swamp forms may be recognized based on the base-rich/pH gradient, i.e., calcareous-rich (eutrophic), intermediate (mesotrophic), and poor (oligotrophic to ombrotrophic) (National Wetlands Working Group 1997).<br /><br />There are two general physiognomic variants of Boreal Swamp & Flooded Forest: coniferous (needle-leaved) swamps and hardwood (broad-leaved deciduous) swamps. Mixtures of the above can also be described. The understory contains shade-tolerant forest species. Generally in boreal regions, deciduous hardwood swamps occur in somewhat richer conditions, giving way to shrub swamps and marshes as conditions get wetter. Coniferous swamps occur across a wider range of trophic levels from rich to poor (National Wetlands Working Group 1997).'},\n",

       "  'Environment': {'Environmental Description': '<i>Climate:</i> This formation occurs typically within an annual precipitation range of 100-150 cm though lower and upper extremes are around 40 and 200 cm, respectively. The rainfall is seasonal, with either a short (1-3 months) dry season or a long one (5-7 months). The wet season can be interrupted by a short period of drought that may last for 1 to 3 weeks. As distance from the equator increases, different types of savanna may form distinct zones, a pattern that results from the longer and longer dry seasons experienced, and the less and less total annual precipitation received the closer an area is to the permanent high pressure cells centered near 30° latitude in both hemispheres (Woodward 2008). Mean annual temperature is about 22-25°C, but can reach 6°C in winter at the edges of the tropical distribution range (e.g., southern limit of Cerrado in Brazil, eastern southern Africa), with very occasional frosts.<br /><br />Tropical savannas occur in areas with distinct annual rhythms based on alternating wet and dry seasons. Abundant precipitation during the rainy season makes this a type of tropical humid climate known as the Tropical Wet and Dry Climate (Aw in the Köppen climate classification system), or often simply the Tropical Savanna Climate. The rains come during the high sun period, when the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is positioned nearby. The ITCZ is the place where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern hemispheres meet and force the air to rise and generate rainfall. Its position shifts during the year as the vertical rays of the sun migrate between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. The low sun season, when the vertical rays strike in the opposite hemisphere, is the dry season. There may be 3-4 months when little or no precipitation falls. Total precipitation within the biome varies from 100-150 cm (40-60 inches) to as little as 50 cm (20 inches) a year (Woodward 2008). The tropical nature of the climate is apparent in the year-round warm temperatures, with frost being an unknown or extremely rare event. The temperature difference between the warmest month (usually at the end of the dry season) and the coolest month (during low sun) is only 2.8-5.5°C (5-10°F). The difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures is often greater (Woodward 2008). Even though a close correlation exists between tropical savannas and the Tropical Wet and Dry Climate, climate does not seem to be the main reason most savannas are found where they are. Repeated burning, low-nutrient soils, iron-rich hardpans close to the surface, and the impacts of large grazing and browsing mammals are also factors in the presence and maintenance of many of the world\\'s tropical grasslands (Woodward 2008).<br /><br /><i>Soil/substrate/hydrology:</i> Tropical savanna usually develops on nutrient-deficient, acidic soils with aluminum toxicity and pronounced alternation of wet and dry conditions (Woodward 2008). Soil formation: Soils in humid tropical climates are exposed to high rates of leaching, the dissolving and washing down into the soil column of any soluble compound. The typical soil-forming process is one of laterization. The amount of leaching that has occurred is related to the age of the land surface. The tropical savannas of Brazil and western Africa lie on very ancient surfaces (exposed continental shields) that for millions of years have been affected by high temperatures and relatively high amounts of rainfall. The bedrock has been deeply weathered, and most soluble compounds, including even silica compounds, have been removed. Since plant matter decays rapidly in constant warm, moist conditions, essentially no humus is available to help bind soluble bases (key plant nutrients) even temporarily. Left behind is a soft residue high in iron oxides and aluminum oxides and lacking most plant nutrients. The high amount of iron in the soils gives them a bright red or yellow color. Concentrations of aluminum can be high enough that the soil is mined as an ore (the ore of aluminum metal is called bauxite). In parts of the Brazilian Highlands, aluminum concentrations are so high as to be toxic to many plants. Native trees and shrubs have special adaptations to withstand these challenging conditions (Woodward 2008).<br /><br />Soils developed on ancient surfaces that are composed of granitic rocks tend to be quite acidic (average pH = 4.9), further reducing the ability of the soil to hold nutrient bases. Another problem for plant life is the repeated wetting and drying of the iron-rich soils that can turn them into a brick-hard layer known as laterite. This hardpan prevents root penetration and halts the percolation of water during the rainy season, creating waterlogged soils or even temporary pools of standing water. The existence of laterite can be one reason for the lack of trees in some tropical savanna areas (Woodward 2008).<br /><br />In some parts of the tropics, weathering and leaching have been neither so prolonged nor extreme. In well-drained areas and regions where the crystalline bedrock is not as old or has been more recently exposed than described above, soil-forming processes more like those of temperate regions (podzolization) are able to take place. Over much of eastern and southern Africa, for example, the savanna soils are less acidic (pH = 6.2) and somewhat more fertile than on the more ancient shield surfaces (Woodward 2008). On base-rich bedrock such as basalt or limestone, soils develop that are high in essential plant nutrients such as calcium and magnesium (both are bases). They typically have a high clay content that makes them swell during the wet season and shrink and crack during the dry season. Such soils have relatively high natural fertility and tend to be associated with grass savannas (Woodward 2008).<br /><br />Soil types: The typical, iron- and aluminum-rich, low-nutrient soils of the ancient plateaus of Africa and South America are classified in the U.S. Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff 1999) as Oxisols. \"Oxi\" refers to the oxides of those two elements that are so concentrated by tropical soil-forming processes. Similar soils are also found in the Tropical Rainforest Biome. In other classifications, they are known as Latosols or lateritic soils (Woodward 2008). Where drainage is better or younger crystalline rock forms the parent material of the soils, the soils are Ultisols according to the U.S. Soil Taxonomy. \"Ulti\" means ultimate or last: the last of the nutrients have been removed by leaching (Woodward 2008). The more fertile soils developed on basalt or limestone and still containing abundant plant nutrients are among the Vertisols of the U.S. Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff 1999). \"Vert\" means turn. The swelling and shrinking of the clay mixes or turns the soil so that no true horizons can form. In other soil classification systems, they are more vividly named \"black cracking soils\" (Woodward 2008).'},\n",

       "  'Overview': {'Classification Comments': 'Savanna refers to a type of vegetation where grasses form a complete ground cover but there may also be an upperstory of scattered trees, shrubs, or palms. The word <i>savanna</i> comes from a Carib word for a treeless plain covered with grass (i.e., a grassland). The Spanish adopted the term when they colonized the West Indies, and they introduced it to other western languages. Today, among vegetation scientists, the meaning has changed somewhat: \"savanna\" refers to a type of vegetation where grasses form a complete ground cover; an upperstory of scattered trees, shrubs, or palms is usual (thus tropical grasslands, with or without scattered trees, are referred to as savannas). The term is mostly reserved to describe tropical vegetation, and the popular image of tropical savanna comes from the African part of the biome, where vast grasslands dotted with umbrella-shaped deciduous trees and thorny shrubs are inhabited by herds of large grazing animals. But it can also include low-statured woody vegetation with a strong graminoid layer, such as the Neotropical cerrado, or scrubby forms of African savanna.<br /><br />The term savanna has also been applied to vegetation of similar structure in temperate zones, but there the term grassland or prairie is used for non-treed grasslands, and savanna is only used when scattered trees are present (between 10 and 30%); these stands are placed in <i>1. ~Forest & Woodland Class (C01)$$</i>. Some scientists use the term <i>savanna landscape</i> to describe a group of interrelated grassland, gallery or riparian forest, swamps, and/or marsh vegetation.<br /><br />Savannas in tropical Asia are most likely \"derived\" and not natural savannas. This means that they are the result of human activities such as logging, burning, and the grazing of livestock, any or all of which altered tropical dry (or deciduous) forests that once grew in the area. Since they are not considered natural, the tropical savannas of India and Southeast Asia are not described in this report (Woodward 2008).<br /><br />The Caribbean pine savannas, like other treed savannas, should be placed according to the percent coverage of the tree layer. Where grasses and shrubs overtop low trees (\"brush prairie\"), the stands are placed here in <i>2. ~Shrub & Herb Vegetation Class (C02)$$</i>. In the tropics, the separation between the lowland shrubland and grassland and warm semi-desert thorn woodland/shrubland should be guided by the presence of succulents, small-leaved and thorny shrubs and trees, and other xeromorphic growth forms, characteristic of the latter.<br /><br />Savannas that flood seasonally are common in the tropics, especially in South America (the Llanos, Beni, and Pantanal). The extensive hydrologic network combined with topographic complexities and precipitation gradients cause a complex spatial mosaic of upland and seasonally flooded types that might be challenging to classify, with waterlogged soils grading into drained soils within very short distances.<br /><br />This type may extend to nearly treeline (3000 m elevation), covering the lower montane region.

       "  'Vegetation': {'Dynamics': \"Fire: Fire is such a common feature of the savanna environment that its presence is sometimes included in the list of factors that define a savanna. Natural fires are part of the seasonal rhythm of life. Sparked by lightning, they usually occur just as the rainy season begins. The rain of the earliest storms may evaporate before reaching the ground, so lightning strikes last year's accumulation of dead leaves and dry stalks. The continuous cover of dried grass carries the flame across the landscape. Both plants and animals show adaptations to the annual grass fires. Trees have thick bark that, while it may get scorched, protects the living tissue beneath it from damage. Some trees and shrubs have buds below the ground surface - where they are insulated from the heat - and are able to resprout quickly. Grasses and subshrubs have underground structures that are similarly protected from the all but the hottest of fires. Burning reduces plant tissues to their component minerals and deposits them as a layer of ash on the ground. The ash is a short-lived coating of fertilizer that promotes rapid new growth in the recovering plants (Woodward 2008).<br /><br />Humans have greatly increased the frequency of fires and expanded the area covered by savannas. Our earliest known ancestors originated on the savannas of Africa. Early humans may have increased the habitat best suited to them by burning grasslands at the edge of forests and gradually converting dry forests and rainforests to savanna. Some suggest that we continue to create savannas well outside the tropics, but now we call them lawns and parks - that we have some kind of inherited memory that makes us prefer grasslands with scattered trees (Woodward 2008).<br /><br />Grazing: On the savannas of eastern and southern Africa, the impact of the large numbers and great diversity of ungulates appears to play a major role in producing and maintaining the habitat mosaic of the savanna landscape. In their absence the natural vegetation would likely be a woodland or forest. These grazers may damage the trees in the woodland, opening the woodland canopy and let sun reach the ground. This lets tall, sun-loving C4 grasses become established and turns the woodland into savanna. Once there is a continuous ground cover of grass, fire easily spreads through the area. Fire kills tree saplings and seedlings and thereby prevents the regeneration of many woody plants. New shoots of grasses attract grazers, whose nibbling and trampling of tree seedlings further inhibits the regrowth of woody plants. Browsing animals consume the foliage, fruits, and twigs of any trees or shrubs tolerant of fire and keep stands of woody plants in check (Woodward 2008).<br /><br />The vegetation change is reversible, however. Heavy grazing pressure or overgrazing can break up the continuous grass cover and result in patches of bare ground. Under these conditions, fire is less able to move across the land, and shrubs and trees invade the open places. The invading species of woody plants are usually armed with thorns to help fend off browsing animals. Each herbivore has its own preferred habitat and forage type within the savanna landscape. South American and Australian savannas lack the ungulates so characteristic of Africa's grasslands. Small mammals and invertebrates are significant plant-eaters, but they do not seem to impact the savanna landscape in the major way African ungulates do (Woodward 2008).\",\n",
       "   'Physiognomy and Structure': 'Stands are dominated by any mesomorphic herb or shrub growth form, with or without a layer of nonvascular growth form (i.e., lichen, moss). Mesomorphic shrubs include <i>broad-leaved, sclerophyllous</i>, and <i>palm</i>. Semi-shrubs are typically absent. Mesomorphic herbs include forbs (including <i>flowering forbs</i> and <i>ferns</i>) and graminoids. \"Savanna\" refers to a type of vegetation where grasses form a complete ground cover; an upperstory of scattered trees, shrubs, or palms is usual. Stands vary widely from regular shrub or herb horizontal stem spacing to irregular, typically with a moderately open shrub layer. There is <40% mesomorphic tree cover, trees are <8 m tall, and the majority of shrub and/or herb growth forms is mesomorphic, typically exceeding 10% cover (but may be as low as 1-10%). Nonvascular and dwarf-shrub growth forms may vary from 0 to 10%, and tree seedlings or saplings may be present at any level of cover, if they are below the predominant heights of the shrubs and herbs. At maturity, dominant shrubs and herbs are typically >0.3 m (sometimes over 5-10 m).<br /><br />The typical grasses are bunchgrasses, some 2-4 m high. The blades are tough and contain many silica bodies. Savanna grasses use the C4 photosynthetic pathway. In addition to grasses, the herb layer of tropical savannas is often rich in sedges and forbs. Trees of the savannas, with the exception of the huge <i>Adansonia digitata</i> (baobab), are rarely taller than 12 m. Most are only 2-6 m tall. A thick bark often defends savanna trees against fire. Many can sprout from their roots, another survival tactic in the face of frequent burning. In Africa, where grazing by large mammals is a major factor, many woody plants are armed with thorns. These same trees and shrubs are apt to have tiny leaves and very deep taproots. Other growth forms commonly found in tropical savannas include subshrubs and annual forbs and grasses, all well-adapted to strongly seasonal environments. The subshrub dies down at the end of one rainy season and produces new woody stems at the beginning of the next. Two flowering seasons are usual in the Tropical Savanna Biome. Some plants bloom at the very beginning of the rainy season even before their leaves have fully developed. Other species bloom in the middle of the rainy season or towards its end. Ecologists recognize different types of savanna according to the spacing and frequency of trees or other woody plants (Woodward 2008). The typical grasses are bunchgrasses, some 2-4 m high. In addition to grasses, the herb layer of tropical savannas is often rich in sedges and forbs. Many of the forbs are members of the pea or legume family (Woodward 2008).'},\n",

The elevational range varies depending on the location, but it is the correlation between elevation and a decrease in temperature that, in natural conditions, generates the replacement of forested vegetation with grasslands and shrublands. There are other factors, such as the effect of recent glaciation periods, and anthropogenic disturbance as well. The variability in elevation range goes together with a great variation in climate among locations, but in general, the mean annual temperature for this type should be between 3° and 12°C, with lower locations reaching a maximum of 18°C average annual temperature, the greatest fluctuation in temperature occurring daily rather than seasonally. Due to the mountain setting, precipitation is highly variable as well, not only in the annual amount but its distribution, with some locales having a marked dry season and others more humid throughout the year.<br /><br /><i>Soil/substrate/hydrology:</i> Given the volcanic origin of several tropical mountains, they have volcanic ash soils, with very high organic content and a high water-holding capacity.

The main reason for this split is that in the Tropics, the true cryomorphic vegetation, super-páramo and higher elevation puna, are treated in 4.A. They grow above 4300 m elevation up to the permanent snowline, with mean annual temperatures <3°C, and soils have cryomorphic features (such as cryoturbation). Physiognomic distinctions are mostly based on the ground cover of the formation, which is continuous as compared to the low, semi-open coverage of the tropical cryomorphic formations.<br /><br />Still, as defined here, <i>2.A.2 ~Tropical Montane Grassland & Shrubland Formation (F017)$$</i> often is found at elevations above 3000 m, which means that <i>2.A.1. ~Tropical Lowland Grassland, Savanna & Shrubland Formation (F019)$$</i> extends up to 3000 m. This may be problematic with respect to the use of Montane versus Lowland as used, though usually there is a forest band between the two.
